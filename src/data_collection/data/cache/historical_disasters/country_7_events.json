            "description": "<p>On December 17, 2024, a powerful magnitude 7.3 earthquake struck near Vanuatu's capital, Port Vila, around 02:25 PM, leaving thousands of people in urgent need of aid. Immediate priorities include life-saving Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) supplies, first aid, health services, and psychological support. A State of Emergency was declared on December 17, 2024, in the worst-affected areas of Vanuatu for a duration of seven days.</p>\n<p>By December 18, the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) confirmed 14 fatalities caused by collapsed buildings and landslides. The death toll could rise as search and rescue operations expand. Over 200 people have been injured, with many still missing. According to UNICEF staff on-site, injuries are primarily fractures, cuts, and trauma caused by falling debris. The Government of Vanuatu (GoV) estimates that over 80,000 people have been affected. Two major water reservoirs in Port Vila are severely damaged, forcing residents to ration water as assessments of the water network continue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The earthquake has caused widespread structural damage, with many buildings either collapsing or severely damaged, including diplomatic missions. Telecommunication services are largely disrupted, with reliable communication limited to those using Starlink systems.</p>\n<p>At Vila Central Hospital, emergency care is being delivered outside the facility due to concerns about the building's structural safety. The hospital's operating theatre is non-functional, and temporary tents have been set up to treat the injured.</p>\n<p>Landslides and damage to roads and bridges have restricted access to the airport and seaport. While the seaport remains closed, the airport is operational for incoming humanitarian aid.</p>",

The death toll could rise as search and rescue operations expand. Over 200 people have been injured, with many still missing. According to UNICEF staff on-site, injuries are primarily fractures, cuts, and trauma caused by falling debris. The Government of Vanuatu (GoV) estimates that over 80,000 people have been affected. Two major water reservoirs in Port Vila are severely damaged, forcing residents to ration water as assessments of the water network continue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The earthquake has caused widespread structural damage, with many buildings either collapsing or severely damaged, including diplomatic missions. Telecommunication services are largely disrupted, with reliable communication limited to those using Starlink systems.</p>\n<p>At Vila Central Hospital, emergency care is being delivered outside the facility due to concerns about the building's structural safety. The hospital's operating theatre is non-functional, and temporary tents have been set up to treat the injured.</p>\n<p>Landslides and damage to roads and bridges have restricted access to the airport and seaport.

Initial reports suggest at least six unconfirmed fatalities and major communication disruptions, which delayed contact with the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO) and government officials until around 6:30 PM local time. Starlink was eventually activated to restore communication with the NDMO.</p>\r\n<p>Communication, electricity, and water outages have significantly impacted the affected areas following the earthquake. Rapid initial response efforts are underway, with communities urgently requesting shelter for evacuees now staying on football fields without protection. Local authorities have emphasized the need for supplies such as drinking water, tarpaulins, medicine, and shelter materials and tools. Internet services remain down in the affected regions, with Starlink being relied upon for communication as telecom providers Vodafone and Digicel work to assess damages and restore their networks. Reports have confirmed six deaths due to a landslide and two people rescued from a collapsed building, while the search for additional missing individuals is ongoing.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Key highlights:</strong><br>â€¢ Â  Â Magnitude 7.3 earthquake near Port Vila, Vanuatu.<br>â€¢ Â  Â Occurred on December 17, 2024, at 12:47 PM local time.<br>â€¢ Â  Â Epicentre 30 km west of Port Vila at a depth of 57 km.<br>â€¢ Â  Â At least 6 unconfirmed deaths.<br>â€¢ Â  Â Communication, electricity, and water outages reported.<br>â€¢ Â  Â Rapid initial response underway.<br>â€¢ Â  Â Evacuees are sheltering on football fields without proper protection.<br>â€¢ Â  Â Supplies Needed are Drinking water, Tarpaulins, Medicine, Shelter materials and tools.<br>â€¢ Â  Â Internet services still down; Star link activated to support communication.<br>â€¢ Â  Â Vodafone and Digicel assessing damages to restore networks.<br>â€¢ Â  Â 6 deaths confirmed from a landslide.<br>â€¢ Â  Â 2 rescued from a collapsed building.<br>â€¢ Â  Â Search ongoing for additional missing individuals.<br>â€¢ Â  Â VRCS Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) activated on 17 December 2024.<br>â€¢ Â  Â VRCS Staff on standby for response.<br>â€¢ Â  Â 10 volunteers deployed to Vila Central Hospital Medical Store.<br>â€¢ Â  Â Shelter Officer on route around the island for observation and assessment.</p>\r\n<p>The Government of Vanuatu is leading the humanitarian response and all national clusters are actively coordinating and meeting regularly with all the partners.

Communication networks are slowly getting back. Digicel Network is now operational in North Pentecost and Vodafone Network will soon to be operational in North Pentecost. In Malampa, many communities are well organized after the cyclone to carry out their first response actions. They are helping other families who are in need, working to quick fix their family shelters, and helping to rebuild or reconstructing new roads to maintain access. In Shefa, communities are prioritizing rebuilding destroyed toilets to ensure good hygiene and reduce pressures to the health system. As per rapid assessment and inputs from the communities, there will be enough food for the next 3 weeks. The economy of the island depends a lot on the market of fresh garden produce and fishing. Seedling of crops and vegetable is needed with immediate response.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\">There is also the need to supply garden tools such as crowbar, spade iron, knife, chain saw, knife, axes, etc. In all affected provinces, WASH is the major challenge as water supply issues ranging from contaminated sources due to saltwater intrusion to limited supplies because of drought conditions. Many communities need community tanks and water catchment to address clean water issue. This lack of a clean source of water is putting the affected population with increased risks of water borne diseases. Food insecurity in the affected provinces from damaged crops from fields and gardens. Source planting material is a priority activity. Medicines and health assets are limited as road blockages continue to hinder movement.</p>",

While significant progress has been made in restoring essential communication networks, including radio and satellite systems, aiding coordination and information sharing for disaster response and recovery, issues remain in connecting with many parts of Penama and Ambrym Island. Road closures due to blockages and landslides are also preventing relevant government agencies and aid organizations from accessing areas for assessment and distribution. In addition, public road access and feeder roads to gardens are also blocked, affecting food security risks and livelihood. Root crops and&nbsp;<br>vegetables are partly damaged in North Ambrym communities and 939 households will face food shortages in one to two weeks. Crops from gardens are decaying due to the impact of salt spray on farmlands in East Vanua Lava. All gardens have been severely destroyed, and households would face shortage of food in less than a week in East Gaua &amp; Mere Lava.In many parts of North&nbsp;Ambrym and Pentecost Island, safe water is a critical issue. Water storage tanks are contaminated with green leaves causing the water to turn green and black and saltwater intrusions to underground wells in other are also creating access to clean water. This shortage comes at a time of drought in many of the affected areas</p>",

            "description": "Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-Hazards Department (VMGD) issued an update on Yasur volcano on 22nd October 2021 that Yasur volcano alert is currently on Level 2 and the activity has intensified in the level of major unrest state. \nThe observations on ground indicate that Yasur volcano has emitted massive plumes of volcanic ashes and gas at around 2pm on 22nd October till late in the night. With this massive activity, the danger zone is increased to 1KM around the volcano cone and the danger zone for life safety is moved to danger zone B (See picture below). Some explosions remain intensified and volcanic projectiles or bombs may fall in and around the summit crater. The level of risk for visitors accessing areas from the crater rim to the parking area (Danger Zone A) remains high. With this current level of activity, villages located close to the volcano may continue to expect volcanic gases and/or ash fall impacts, especially those exposed to the wind direction.\nMap of Danger ZONE\n \n\n Tafea Province Government has activated the PDEOC on the 25th Oct 2021 at the PDO conference room. All Government officer and working Partners at the provincial level, have attended the sectorial meeting facilitated and coordinated by the PDO at the PDEOC before the team deployment to the field at 1pm.\nThe purpose of activating the EOC was to monitor and report on the acid rain that occurred on the 21st of October 2021 followed by the heavy ashfall on the 22nd October 2021 \nThe heavy rainfall caused the landslide to fall into the crater of the volcano, which triggered the eruption. Heavy ash fall felt towards the South East of the Island. The area is consisted of one Area Council. The South East Tanna Area Council is made up of 14 different tribes and has a total of 30 communities. \nAs per Assessment report analysis, the following were considered to be the priority Needs:\n-\tWater\n-\tShelter\n-\tFood\n-\tHealth Protection\n-\tLivelihood",
