            "description": "<p>On October 12, 2024, severe flooding began along the Senegal River in Mauritania due to heavy rains across the sub-region and a water release from the Manantali Dam . This disaster has severely impacted tens of thousands of residents across a 700-kilometer stretch of the river, affecting the regions of Guidimakha, Gorgol, Brakna, and Trarza.</p>\n<p>The rising waters have submerged numerous villages, destroying homes, crops, and livestock, and displacing many already vulnerable communities. The first affected area was the riverside village of Diawara, where homes were rapidly flooded. As the water levels continued to rise, more neighborhoods were impacted, displacing additional families and creating challenging conditions for movement.</p>\n<p>In response, many families initially took refuge in school buildings, transforming these spaces into temporary shelters. However, as the floods expanded, these shelters were also affected, leading to the suspension of the local education system.</p>\n<p>The ongoing flooding has created urgent needs for shelter, food, and essential services, with substantial impacts on infrastructure and the well-being of the affected population.</p>",

            "description": "Le 1er septembre 2020, la wilaya du Hodh Echargui, située dans le sud-est du pays, à la frontière du Mali, a connu des pluies diluviennes qui ont dépassé la barrière de 100 mm dans certaines zones. Relevant de cette région, les villes de Bassiknou, Adel Begrou, Amourj notamment et Néma, la capitale de la région.\nLa pluie diluvienne a causé un lourd bilan dans les trois départements de la région, en particulier dans le département de Bassiknou entrainant, à grande échelle, de considérables dégâts matériels, au niveau des infrastructures telles que les routes, les ponts, les digues de protection, les marchés, les sources d'approvisionnement en eau, en plus de la destruction d'une grande partie des stocks alimentaires familiaux.\nDans la ville de Bassiknou, la majorité des quartiers résidentiels a été gravement touchée par les inondations et les dégâts varient en intensité d’un quartier à l’autre. Une commission d’évaluation des dégâts, dont le CRM est membre, a été mise en place par les autorités.\n \nCette commission a commencé le recensement des ménages touchés malgré les difficultés d'accès.  D’après les résultats partiels, 1 200 familles ont déjà été enregistrées uniquement dans le département de Bassiknou sans compter les autres départements de la région qui sont touchés par les inondations. Le travail de la commission d'évaluation est toujours en cours.\nDans les deux autres départements de Néma et d’Amourj, ainsi que dans l’arrondissement d’Adel Bagrou, on note des dégâts matériels et plus de 184 familles sinistrées au niveau d’Adel Bagrou et 64 familles sinistrées au niveau d’Amourj qui vivent dans des conditions très précaires.\nLa commune de Dhar, relevant du département de Bassiknou et située à 80 km de Bassiknou, a été entièrement touchée ; on compte ici plus de 118 ménages qui ont perdu leur habitation et qui sont actuellement accueillis par leurs proches. D’autre part, 17 magasins de stock alimentaire ont été détruits et du bétail a été emporté par les eaux. \nA Bassiknou, quelques écoles ayant été endommagées partiellement par les pluies, la reprise des cours prévue le 1er septembre 2020 sur l’ensemble de territoire national a été retardée.\n\nFace à cette situation désastreuse, plusieurs tentatives menées par les autorités pour accéder aux sinistrés au niveau de Bassiknou ont été effectuées sans succès : il n’y a que le préfet du département de Bassiknou, qui est sur place avec ses collaborateurs, qui a pu accéder à certains quartiers des zones inondées.\n\nUn peu plus tard, le 5 septembre 2020, une délégation gouvernementale composée du commissaire à la sécurité alimentaire et le gouverneur de la région, est arrivée à Bassiknou pour s’enquérir de la situation des communautés qui ont été touchées par les pluies torrentielles ayant frappé de nombreuses zones de la région. L’objet de cette visite était de s’enquérir de l’état des sinistrés, de soulager les familles touchées par les inondations et de s’assurer de l'avancement des travaux qui ont été menés sur plusieurs sites pour creuser des canaux de drainage des eaux de pluie et opérer la réfection des barrages effondrés.\n\nDans ce contexte, des citernes en renfort ont été mises à disposition par le ministère de l'Hydraulique et de l'assainissement à la périphérie de la ville de Bassiknou, prêtes à intervenir, le cas échéant.\n\nLa présence de la délégation gouvernementale a également été l’occasion d’acheminer une aide alimentaire aux sinistrés dont la distribution commencera sous peu dans la localité de Legneiba, dans la commune de Dhhar, située à 80 km de la ville de Bassiknou.\n\nNous rappelons que l'Office national de la météorologie a déjà averti la population, en particulier dans les régions du Sud-Est de la Mauritanie, notamment la région du Hodh Echargui, de la possibilité de fortes pluies, rappelant à la population de faire preuve de la plus grande prudence et du strict respect des consignes de sécurité relatives à ce genre de catastrophe afin de réduire les risques probables.\n",
