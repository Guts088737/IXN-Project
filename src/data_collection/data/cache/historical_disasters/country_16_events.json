The floods resulted in the deaths of 5 people, left 1 person missing, and injured over 100 individuals. Approximately 250 families have been affected by damage to their homes, and about 700 people were displaced due to the destruction of houses or unsafe living conditions.</p>\n<p data-start=\"708\" data-end=\"1223\">The impact has been devastating for rural livelihoods. Over 3,000 livestock&mdash;mainly sheep and turkeys&mdash;were lost, with further losses still being counted. At least 12 farms and 60 hectares of crops were destroyed, and damage assessments are ongoing. In terms of shelter, 252 houses were damaged, including 110 in Tiaret, 80 in Djelfa, 14 in M&rsquo;Sila, and 48 in Laghouat. Infrastructure has also suffered severely, with multiple roads rendered impassable and at least five bridges either collapsed or critically damaged.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1225\" data-end=\"1662\">Vulnerable rural and semi-rural communities have experienced major disruptions to their livelihoods, mobility, and access to essential services. Entire neighborhoods remain inundated, and vital transport links such as National Road 40 remain inaccessible. Coordination efforts are ongoing, with immediate priorities focusing on emergency shelter, relief item distribution, and psychosocial support for displaced and affected populations.</p>",

The wilayas of Djelfa, M&rsquo;Sila, Tiaret, Biskra, M&eacute;d&eacute;a, Ouled Djellal, Laghouat, and Tipaza were among the hardest hit. The sudden rise in wadi water levels led to fatal accidents, including vehicle washouts and child drownings. Families were evacuated from inundated homes, livestock losses were reported in rural areas, and key roadways such as National Road 40 were rendered impassable. The affected population includes vulnerable rural households, travelers, and communities living in flood-prone zones. Some have suffered the loss of loved ones, housing damage, and disruption of livelihoods, especially in agrarian areas where livestock perished in large numbers. Ongoing search and rescue efforts continue in Biskra and other regions, while drainage, emergency shelter, and relief distribution remain priorities.</p>",

In Beni Abbes, rising water levels cut off major roads, and there is a high risk of house damages from the overflow of the rivers at the opening of Bechar dam. Meanwhile, in Tamanrasset, 50 families from Nomads have been affected, with search and rescue operations ongoing for missing persons following heavy flooding. Tragically, the floods have claimed four lives, including three persons in Bechar and one person in Naama.
