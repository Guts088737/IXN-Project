The disaster directly affected 90 traders and 585 dependents, while more than 3,500 people who rely on the market’s services are now facing economic challenges. The market’s loss has further destabilized a region already struggling with limited livelihood options. On 23 January, another fire swept through Djofunco Village in Cacheu Region, destroying 31 homes (12 completely and 19 partially). The fire directly impacted 224 people and indirectly aected the entire village of 800. Families lost homes, food supplies, and farming tools, increasing their economic vulnerability and worsening food insecurity. The village’s remote location and difficult terrain make delivering humanitarian aid even more challenging.",
