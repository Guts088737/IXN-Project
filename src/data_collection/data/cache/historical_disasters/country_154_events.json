Rainfalls were expected from Thursday, September 12th, with the culmination of perturbation on Saturday, September 14th, or Sunday, September 15th. The expected heavy areas were in west and northwest Slovakia, close to the Czech and Polish border and on the lower Danube. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Since Thursday, the Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute has collocated different districts in Slovakia into yellow, orange, or red zones (3rd level of flood alert) during the weekend in the districts of Skalica, Senica, Malacky, Bratislava, Senec, Dunajska Streda, Komarno, and Nove Zamky. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><img src=\"https://prddsgofilestorage.blob.core.windows.net/api/images/7154a.gif\" alt=\"A map of a country\r\n\r\nDescription automatically generated\" width=\"452\" height=\"228\"></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The map from Monday 16<sup>th</sup> of September. <a href=\"https://www.shmu.sk/sk/?page=1680\">https://www.shmu.sk/sk/?page=1680</a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The level of the Kysuca River has risen dangerously due to persistent rainfall (Cadca and Kysucke Nove mesto) The Slovak Hydrometeorological Institute has issued a warning for the Cadca District- 3rd level of flood activity, which is valid from Sunday 15 September from 2:00 to Monday 16 September at 10:00. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">From Friday onwards, the most affected areas are Zahorie (Skalica, Senica, and Malacky) and Myjava, as heavy precipitation was also complicated by the strong wind. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The regional branches in the affected areas are actively participating in the local crisis management boards led by the district offices. So far, </span><span lang=\"EN-US\">besides the Bratislava branch, which received the order from the district office, no</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">assistance has been requested, as the primary focus is on the heavy machinery and equipment for the firefighters who need to enter the affected areas. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As the rainfall in Austria was heavier than expected the situation on the Danube River became more alarming. The Danube in Bratislava has exceeded the third flood level and is expected to reach 950 centimetres on Tuesday (September 17th). Anti-flood barricades were built on the lower sections of the Danube and in the city centre to prevent the river from entering the city as it was flooding out of the riverbed. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The city of Devin is the most affected area of Bratislava, which is impossible to reach if not by heavy machinery. Approximately 200 households were evacuated from Devinska, Nova Ves, and Kuchyna, villages in the northwestern part of Bratislava, which was heavily affected by the floods. Due to the floods, this area is hard to reach, and people have left their homes individually. This area is at a high risk of landslides.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The Bratislava city branch provides the base camp for the first responders (firefighters, police, and army) who are supporting in this affected area. SRC’s volunteers work on rotations, also during the night. They prepare meals for approximately 60 responders. Blankets were also provided. The branch was also requested to assess the situation of the inhabitants, monitor whether they have the medicines they need, and, if necessary, provide the medication so people will not risk leaving their homes. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In some other affected areas, the population was also requested to evacuate. Still, most people left their houses and moved to friends and family, and the established evacuation centres are mostly empty.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The highest third level (red) of alert persists in the western part of Slovakia, in the city of Bratislava, the Bratislava counties, and the towns on the lower course of the Danube River (Nove Zamky and Komarno). </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Since Friday (13 September), more than 100,000 electricity outages have affected more than 100,000 sites in west Slovakia.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The worst situation is in Bratislava, Trencin, and Záhorie, where an emergency operating state has been declared. The main cause of the faults is fallen trees and branches on the lines, which are being continuously eliminated to recover.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">So far, the overall number of affected people is unknown and is not being communicated, even in the daily situation report shared by the Ministry of Interior. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"><img src=\"https://prddsgofilestorage.blob.core.windows.net/api/images/7154b.gif\" width=\"452\" height=\"239\" border=\"0\"></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Update 18<sup>th</sup> September 2024</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As of September 18, 2024, the situation is improving in most of the affected areas but remains critical in Devinska Nova ves (Bratislava County). </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">As per information reported by the regional branches in the most affected areas:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst\"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">1.        </span><!--[endif]--><span lang=\"EN-US\">Cadca—The river Kysuce and other small rivers are returning to the riverbeds, and the count of the damages is about to start.
