The massive quake collapsed many houses trapping residences in the most affected area nearby the epicentre such as Wajima city, Suzu city, Noto town located in northern part of the peninsula. The quake caused fires in some cities which burnt down hundreds of houses. As of 1 February, 1,568 aftershocks have followed the main shock. The tsunami reached coastal areas just after the earthquake, and damaged at least 120 hectares in Suzu City and Noto town. The electric power and water supplies were cut, and the communications of mobile phones, landlines and internet were disrupted in the affected area.

As the epicentre was very shallow (16 km deep), strong tremors were observed in many places and a tsunami warning was issued. The massive quake collapsed many houses trapping residences in the most affected area nearby the epicentre such as Wajima city, Suzu city, Noto town located in northern part of the peninsula. The quake caused fires in some cities which burnt down hundreds of houses. The tsunami reached coastal areas just after the earthquake, and damaged at least 120 hectares in Suzu City and Noto town. The electric power and water supplies were cut, and the communications of mobile phones, landlines and internet were disrupted in the affected area. The roads in the affected area were severely damaged by the quake, and some landslides caused by the quake also prevented the access to/within the affected area. According to the Japan Nuclear Regulation Authority, no issues have been found with reactors at nuclear power plants in the affected area, including the Shika Nuclear Power Plant located in Ishikawa Prefecture. As of 9 January, 1,262 aftershocks have followed the main shock.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\">Impacts</span></strong><span lang=\"EN-US\"><br>As of 9 January, the local government confirmed 202 deaths in Wajima City, Suzu City and other cities/towns, and 102 people in Ishikawa prefecture remain unaccounted for.

On 9 January, Ishikawa Prefecture announced its first &ldquo;disaster-related deaths&rdquo; &ndash; people who died either of injuries or illnesses after having evacuated. It urgently needs to immediately take preventative measures in areas impacted by the earthquake. Despite of the hard efforts by the government and NGOs for recovery of roads and distribution of water, food and non-food items, at least 22 districts staying 3,123 residents in Wajima city, Suzu city, Nanao city, Anamizu town and Noto town are still remained to be isolated with roads cut off and food, water, blanket and fuel, basic needs are still in short supply.

The quake caused fires in some cities which burnt down hundreds of houses. The tsunami reached coastal areas just after the earthquake, and damaged at least 120 hectares in Suzu City and Noto town. The electric power and water supplies were cut, and the communications of mobile phones, landlines and internet were disrupted in the affected area. The roads in the affected area were severely damaged by the quake, and some landslides caused by the quake also prevented the access to/within the affected area. According to the Japan Nuclear Regulation Authority, no issues have been found with reactors at nuclear power plants in the affected area, including the Shika Nuclear Power Plant located in Ishikawa Prefecture. As of 6 January, 1,040 aftershocks have followed the main shock.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins; mso-fareast-font-family: 'ＭＳ Ｐゴシック'; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: JA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">Impacts</span></strong></p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins; mso-fareast-font-family: 'ＭＳ Ｐゴシック'; mso-font-kerning: 0pt; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: JA; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA;\">As of 6 January, the local government confirmed 100 deaths in Wajima City, Suzu City and other cities/towns, and 210 people in Ishikawa prefecture remain unaccounted for.

The quake caused fires in some cities and it is estimated that hundreds of houses were burnt down. More than 30,000 people remained in evacuation centres on the first night of the disaster.

            "description": "Central Japan is currently in the latter part of the summer rainy season. Atami in Shizuoka Prefecture, located about 100 km southwest of Central Tokyo, has recorded 410 mm of rain in 72 hours from Thursday to Saturday, which is 1.7 times more than the average June rainfall.\n\nAt 10:30am on Saturday 3 July (JST), torrential rain triggered mudslides. The mudslides travelled nearly two kilometres. Prefectural officials say the slides damaged at least 130 buildings including houses in their path.\n\nAround 1,100 firefighters, police and Self-Defense Forces personnel were involved in searching for the missing while working to clear away mud and debris using heavy machinery.\n\nNumber details are still under investigation.",
