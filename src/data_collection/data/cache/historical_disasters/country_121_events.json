            "description": "<p>At 1:10 PM local time, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported a powerful 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck central Myanmar, with its epicenter about 17 kilometers from Mandalay, the country&rsquo;s second-largest city. The quake caused widespread destruction, collapsing multiple buildings and prompting emergency teams to respond. Just 12 minutes later, a strong 6.4 magnitude aftershock intensified the devastation, further damaging structures in Mandalay and Sagaing, complicating rescue efforts, and raising fears of more casualties. The full extent of the destruction and official casualty figures remain unclear.</p>\n<p>The earthquake&rsquo;s impact extended beyond Myanmar&rsquo;s borders. In Bangkok, Thailand&mdash;nearly 800 kilometers away&mdash;the tremors triggered mass evacuations of high-rise buildings. The aftershock contributed to further instability, and a partially constructed skyscraper in the Chatuchak district collapsed, though the number of workers inside remains unknown. Metro and light rail services were temporarily suspended as a safety precaution. The tremors were also felt across several countries, leading to evacuations and widespread panic.</p>\n<p>According to&nbsp;<a id=\"menur6al\" class=\"fui-Link ___1q1shib f2hkw1w f3rmtva f1ewtqcl fyind8e f1k6fduh f1w7gpdv fk6fouc fjoy568 figsok6 f1s184ao f1mk8lai fnbmjn9 f1o700av f13mvf36 f1cmlufx f9n3di6 f1ids18y f1tx3yz7 f1deo86v f1eh06m1 f1iescvh fhgqx19 f1olyrje f1p93eir f1nev41a f1h8hb77 f1lqvz6u f10aw75t fsle3fq f17ae5zn\" title=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.theguardian.com%2fworld%2flive%2f2025%2fmar%2f28%2fmyanmar-earthquake-thailand-bangkok-mandalay-latest-news-updates&amp;data=05%7c02%7cfelipe.delcid%40ifrc.org%7c55f0b89d570b4a06b78308dd6ddf7619%7ca2b53be5734e4e6cab0dd184f60fd917%7c0%7c0%7c638787528729822697%7cunknown%7ctwfpbgzsb3d8eyjfbxb0eu1hcgkionrydwusilyioiiwljaumdawmcisilaioijxaw4zmiisikfoijoitwfpbcisilduijoyfq%3d%3d%7c0%7c%7c%7c&amp;sdata=b%2bjwzom7ilsnkwnhkyofvj7kk7xskuatxspvekrehbi%3d&amp;reserved=0\" href=\"https://eur02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2Flive%2F2025%2Fmar%2F28%2Fmyanmar-earthquake-thailand-bangkok-mandalay-latest-news-updates&amp;data=05%7C02%7Cfelipe.delcid%40ifrc.org%7C55f0b89d570b4a06b78308dd6ddf7619%7Ca2b53be5734e4e6cab0dd184f60fd917%7C0%7C0%7C638787528729822697%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=B%2BJwZOm7iLsNkwnHKyOFVj7Kk7xsKuATXspVekRehBI%3D&amp;reserved=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"Link news agency\"><u>news agency</u></a>, Thai Prime Minister declared a state of emergency in Bangkok, urging residents to evacuate tall buildings due to the risk of aftershocks.

Over 85’000 people have been reached by MRCS across Sagaing, Mandalay, Naw Pyi Taw, Bago and Southern Shan where MRCS had pre-existing presence and access through its dozens of branches. MRCS had been delivering assistance prior to the earthquake working with the IFRC network and is able to continue delivering life-saving assistance and relief despite being affected themselves.

With scorching daytime temperatures (around 40 degrees Celsius) and damaged water infrastructure, the risk of dehydration and waterborne diseases is rising. Sanitation facilities are insufficient, especially for families living outdoors.<br><br>The earthquake has severely damaged critical infrastructure, including water and electricity infrastructure, roads, bridges, and airports. Key bridges in the affected regions have collapsed, hindering access and delaying the delivery of humanitarian aid. There have been dozens of intense aftershocks in the affected areas. </div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>Thousands of people are living in tents or makeshift shelters; others have no shelter at all. Many have no means to cook and rely on donations. Diseases and the spread of water borne disease remains a major concern. Many health facilities were severely damaged and remain unsafe or non-functional. In some cases, treatment has moved to hospital gardens or outdoor areas. Affordability of goods is also becoming a big problem.</div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"> </div>\r\n<div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The monsoon and cyclone seasons start early May. During this period, rainfall is expected to quadruple. Recent off-season heavy rains have already complicated the response while temperatures have registered peaks of 44 degrees Celsius.  Even before this latest shock, over a third of the population (approx 20M people) were estimated to need humanitarian assistance by the UN.</div>",

This has resulted in an increase in extreme high temperature days and thus the prevalence of heat-related disorders. Prolonged exposure to extreme heat, resulting in heat stress, is expected to increase in the next five years in all regions and states of Myanmar. According to the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology of Myanmar (DMH), there is high confidence that warming is very likely to continue across Myanmar. Climate change is leading to more frequent and severe heat waves. As global temperatures rise, the occurrence and intensity of heat waves are expected to increase in Myanmar.\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>The MONREC (Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar), in Myanmar's National Adaptation Programme of Action 2016-2030, reports 1,482 cases of heatrelated disorders and 260 heat-related deaths during the summer of 2010 across the country. As a so-called silent killer, heatwave deaths are likely underreported. In addition, the report highlights that local populations in Mandalay are experiencing heat-related stresses and diseases more frequently. It adds that extreme heat days in Mandalay forced all schools to close in 2015.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>In 2010, a heatwave in Mandalay, reaching a daily maximum temperature of 47°C on 20 May 2010, reportedly killed 230 people. On 20 April 2014, during a heatwave with a daily maximum temperature of 41.7°C, 49 heatstroke cases were reported in Mandalay city3 , of which 9 resulted in death.<br>In Yangon, during a heatwave with a daily maximum temperature of 42.2°C in April 20194 , 8 people died from heat-related illnesses.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>Additionally, while the people of Myanmar are accustomed to high temperatures throughout the year, deadly heat extremes have been increasingly recorded in recent years. This poses a problem as people may believe they are prepared for high temperatures, leading to a false safety perception. Some experiences indicate that individuals who did not seek information on heat-related illnesses during heatwaves are potentially at higher risk.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>Rapid industrialization and urbanization in the country are leading to higher temperatures in urban areas, In urban areas located in<br>wet climate zones, such as Yangon, the impacts of the UHI are further intensified by high humidity levels in the air, which heighten the impact on human health. </div>",

The flood has been affecting thousands of households in Shan (East), Kayin, Mon, Rakhine, Mandalay and Tanintharyi. The Department of Meteorology and Hydrology (DMH) Myanmar reported that the low-pressure area over the North Bay of Bengal persists and will remain until October 2021.</div>\r\n<div><br />Since, 30 June 2021, the DMH has been issuing flood advisory warnings and warnings regarding weather systems impacting major rivers and their water level. As weather systems come closer and more information on the expected impact becomes available, public warnings on flooding and landslides are being disseminated. Myanmar’s DMH have reported heavy rain since 25 July 2021, with many areas affected by flood. Since mid-July, people and communities have been impacted by ongoing and recurring floods across Myanmar which requires local level response.<br /><br />The monsoon weather system is strong and active, and on 24 August, DMH forecast predicted water levels may exceed the danger level of major rivers and river dams such as Ayeyarwady River and Sittoung River that are currently in critical situation and could have the ability to impact the most at-risk areas. As of 25 August, the Thanlwin River has exceeded the danger zone (see in Annex forecast).1 There are concerns that the weather system, fluvial floods, and flash floods could cause damage in communities across several regions, particularly in Shan (East), Kayin, Mon, Rakhine, Tanintharyi, Magway, Mandalay, Kachin, Sagaing and Chin regions. Some of these areas have experienced previous devastation by the flood in 2015 and 2017, with response carried out via operation by IFRC EA MDRMM006. It is estimated more than 1.6 million vulnerable people2 are likely to be impacted by sessional monsoon related disasters.</div>",

        "summary": "<strong>Situation Overview<br /><br /><img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/6QQ8cH83/myanmar.png\" alt=\"\" /></strong> <br /><br />The people of Myanmar are dealing with an evolving humanitarian crisis where humanitarian needs have continued to escalate since the third wave of COVID-19 in 2021 and the ongoing political unrest since Myanmar’s military intervention on 1 February 2021.<br /><br />The country is now entering the second year of this crisis, where ongoing inter-factional tensions have fueled its complexity and multi-dimensional characteristics. The Civil Disobedience Movement (CDM) continues to be supported by many in Myanmar, impacting public services, including health, schools, and government administrations in states and regions across the country.<br /><br />Clashes and targeted attacks between various armed actors, including the People’s Defence Forces (PDFs), ethnic armed organizations (EAOs), and the Myanmar Armed Forces (MAF), continue and have intensified in several states/regions. Simmering historical tensions exist across certain key states, and, in some locations, these tensions have become exacerbated as a consequence of military intervention. Numerous new forces have emerged, and several ethnic armed groups, established many years before the military intervention, have become increasingly recommitted to the insurgency resulting in fighting occurring in areas that have been without conflict for decades.<br /><br />Some sources have recorded nearly 13,000 political violence and protest events throughout 2021. The degree of violence against civilians has been severe. The number of casualties has increased, while thousands of houses and the properties of other civilians have been burnt down or destroyed. This has triggered multiple large scale population displacements. As of 28 February 2022,6 roughly 873,000 people have been internally displaced in Myanmar. About 502,600 people have been displaced by insecurity and the increased vulnerability of host and resident communities in affected areas since 1 February 2021. The northwest part of Myanmar (Sagaing, Magway and Chin) has recorded the highest level of new internal displacements, with 246,600 internally displaced persons (IDPs) (49 per cent), followed by the southeast part of Myanmar (Kayin, Kayah, and Shan) with 233,600 IDPs contributing 46.5 per cent. Displaced populations face significant challenges in access to basic needs and services, specifically, food, healthcare, shelter materials, clean water, and sanitation facilities. <br /><br />Myanmar is also experiencing a socio-economic crisis exacerbated by the protracted COVID-19 epidemic. The local currency, the Kyat, has fluctuated with a significant drop in value by 60 per cent in the month of September 2021, while costs for food items, fuel, and other essential goods have soared. In September 2021, inflation increased to 7.3 per cent. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that in 2021, some 1.6 million jobs were lost, leaving only 18.9 million women and men employed. The farming, construction, garment, tourism, and hospitality industries are among the hardest hit. The economic and political volatility is projected to have driven almost half of the population into poverty in 2022.<br /><br />The 2022 Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) for Myanmar , which was published on 31 December 2021, predicts that approximately a quarter of the population (14.4 million people – 4.9 million women and five million children) will be classified as requiring humanitarian support during 2022. Up from about one million people in need before February 2021. This increase is driven by the social, economic and health impacts of COVID-19, worsening food insecurity, and the mass movement of the population since the events of 1 February 2021 and subsequent need for protection. These factors have generated an array of new needs and exacerbated the vulnerability of specific groups. <br /><br />The HNO analysis estimated that 14 out of 15 states and regions in Myanmar are now within the critical threshold for acute malnutrition. Prices for key commodities in some states and regions have increased significantly, resulting in some food items no longer being affordable to many families. At the beginning of 2022, fuel prices increased by 14-18 per cent from the previous month. Compared to the pre-crisis period through to March 2022, fuel prices skyrocketed by 82-150 per cent , impacting transportation costs and contributing to unpredictable commodity prices.<br /><br />Humanitarian access to reach conflict-affected populations remains a major challenge for the Myanmar Red Cross Society (MRCS) and other humanitarian organizations. Travel restrictions are currently in place due to the security context, military checkpoints, stringent administrative authorization requirements, and COVID-19 regulations.<br /><br />This has impacted the distribution of humanitarian resources, direct support from personnel and disrupted monitoring and evaluation activities, including data collection and verification. Several private companies have withdrawn and/or halted services in Myanmar, which has impacted transportation, the supply chain, and costs, eventually delaying humanitarian assistance from reaching those most in need.<br /><br /> With continuous dialogue and advocacy efforts with all stakeholders and state administrators, the MRCS gradually secured safe access to wider vulnerable populations. This engagement is based on autonomous Red Cross Red Crescent-led needs assessments and a decision-making process that supports independent humanitarian action. The MRCS collaborates with both International Red Cross Red Crescent Movement (the Movement) and non-Movement partners, such as UN agencies, to deliver assistance to broader geographic areas. The National Society remains flexible and adaptive to the dynamic operational context to reach the most vulnerable and affected populations whilst ensuring compliance with security protocols for mobilizing personnel.",
