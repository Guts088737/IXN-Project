The most affected districts are Hurungwe, Makonde, Zvimba, Mhondoro and Kariba, with 643 cases reported in the last 24 hours and a Case Fatality Rate of 0.36%. Mashonaland West Province specifically accounts for approximately 12.8% of the cases, placing it among the top four provinces affected by malaria, alongside Mashonaland Central, Manicaland, and Mashonaland East. Since January 2025, Mash West has recorded 11,790 cumulative cases and 42 confirmed deaths (MoHCC SitRep, April 2025). The cumulative malaria cases for weeks 1 to 15 increased by 107% from 17,539 cases in 2024 to 36,423 cases in 2025 (MoHCC, Malaria Highlights, 2025). Major risk factors include low risk perception and late health-seeking behaviour, resulting in patients presenting at the local health facility very late. As such, most patients are presenting at the health facility in severe conditions, leading to deaths. The 2023/24 La Nina season brought a lot of rainfall across the entire country, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. Malaria is one of the top 5 killers of children under five in Zimbabwe, especially in rural and endemic provinces, including Mashonaland West. Malaria transmission in Zimbabwe is high during the rainy season, where approximately 67.5% of the population is at risk. Transmission in the country is usually from November to May, and the peak transmission period is from February to May of each year.",

The focus on managing the malaria outbreak has diverted attention and resources from other essential health services, such as maternal and child health programs, immunizations, and management of chronic diseases. Other secondary effects include absenteeism from work among adults and from school among children, affecting their academic performance and long-term educational outcomes. The outbreak has also caused anxiety and stress among community members, particularly in areas with high infection rates.

Hence, the next elections will be held on the 23rd of August 2023 and will include the Presidential, Parliamentary and Local council elections. Following the constitution, If there is no outright winner in the presidential contest (winning with more than 50% votes), a run-off will is held six weeks later (october). Dubbed as “dry run” to this year’s contested election, the by-election tension, voting process and the extreme political polarization in the country may lead to situations of violence during the election period. Already, politically linked violent events have been reported successively since 2022. The most significant recent examples include some skirmishes reported in recent weeks which led malicious damage to property, livelihoods and infrastructure reported in Nyatsime, Chitungwiza on the outskirts of Harare.</p>\r\n<p>Hence, multiple elements are indicating a possibility of violence in the impending 2023 elections.</p>\r\n<p>This analysis highlighted by several analysis from experts, media National and international is premised on the following indicators:</p>\r\n<p>a. The historical trend in Zimbabwe depicts an upsurge of violence around elections time. Inter and intra-political party skirmishes at recent political meetings and the 22 March 2022 By-election. In March 2022, the country held by-elections to fill vacant parliamentary and council seats. The run-up to these by-elections witnessed violence incidences and, in some cases, Red Cross volunteers assisted the victims.</p>\r\n<p>b. There are verbal attacks and counter attacks in the media between the political parties with increased political activism in the country leading to a tense political environment.</p>\r\n<p>c. Lack of political tolerance in some areas which has previously experienced disputed election results which in turn ignited violence.</p>\r\n<p>d. Inadequate reconciliation efforts post 2008 violence and the deaths and injuries in the post 2018 election period which predisposes people towards a tendency of violence as revenge.</p>\r\n<p>e. Possibility of an increase in migration towards the elections as people return to vote.</p>\r\n<p>f. Emerging pressure groups which are not directly affiliated to political parties wield potential influence in political agitation.</p>\r\n<p>g. Proliferation of social media (Facebook, Twitter &amp; WhatsApp) as political mobilization tools may result in mass agitation and protests.</p>\r\n<p>h. The economic challenges and hardships have heightened tension which may cause political agitation and sporadic incidences of public disobedience (riots and protests).</p>",

The crude mortality rate remains above 2.2% and raises concerns regarding case management and the quality of care. Due to the high rate of transmission, the disease is now affecting people across multiple geographical areas. To date, suspected and confirmed cases have been reported in 45 out of 62 districts and in all 10 provinces of the country. The outbreak has now spread to more than the 17 traditional cholera hotspot districts, putting at risk over 10 million people, including more than five million children. Transmission routes from Buhera and Mutare have contributed to the spread of the outbreak in urban populations as well as the spike in cases in Harare and Chitungwiza.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">The capacity of the Ministry of Health and Child Care has been stretched due to the high number of admissions, lack of human resources to manage the caseload, and lack of cholera supplies, including disinfection liquids, to stop the transmission. There is a disrupted community health care system where primary health care - which is responsible for ensuring that community members adhere to water, sanitation, and hygiene practices - is overwhelmed. Active case findings and surveillance have been challenged, compounded by inadequate logistical supplies. There is a need to mobilise and train more volunteers to support task shifting from medical personnel to volunteers, as well as support in increasing the awareness of risks and treatment.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">In June 2023, the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society (ZRCS) requested CHF 464,595 from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) Disaster Response Emergency Fund to fight the cholera outbreak, which showed a positive response in the targeted districts. However, the outbreak has spread to new districts, prompting the ZMRC to move the current situation in its scenario planning to a “worst-case scenario”. The launch of this Emergency Appeal for CHF 3 million is to enable the ZRCS to further scale-up their response, with 550,455 people targeted across the most affected and vulnerable districts and their communities.</span></p>",

The resulted in the area planted to maize decreasing by 1% from 1 920 541ha in the 2020/21 season to 1 903 669 Ha in 2021/22 (2021-22 First Round Crop Assessment Report)\nThis is likely to result in below-average harvests by April or May which will only result in temporary improvements to food security outcomes. As reported by Fews Net, in typical surplus-producing areas, Minimal (IPC Phase 1) outcomes will be limited, while Stressed (IPC Phase 2) outcomes will be widespread. Typical deficit-producing areas are expected to experience mainly Stressed (IPC Phase 2) as households will only be able to meet their minimal food needs but not their non-food needs. These areas, mainly parts of Manicaland, Masvingo, Midlands, and the Matabeleland Provinces are expected to deteriorate to Crisis (IPC Phase 3) by July, prompting an early start to the next lean season.",

        "summary": "<p>The IFRC Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) has approved a total of CHF 549,318.00 for the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society’s Early Action Protocol on droughts. The approved amount consists of an allocation of CHF 182,440 for readiness and CHF 366,878 allocated to implement early actions once the defined triggers are met. Allocations are made from the Anticipatory Pillar of the DREF, under the DREF appeal code MDR00001. Unearmarked contributions to the DREF are encouraged to guarantee enough funding is available for the Early Action Protocols being developed. The Drought Early Action Protocol (EAP) for the Zimbabwe Red Cross Society (ZRCS) is a tool to guide the timely and effective implementation of early actions based on forecast and observational data, which predict meteorological hazards with a high likelihood of humanitarian impact. Drought (Meteorological and Agricultural) is the most common and high-impact natural hazard occurring in Zimbabwe, both in terms of frequency of occurrence and the number of people affected, with droughts accounting for 7 out of the 10 top major natural hazards since recorded 1990. Due to increasing climatic uncertainty, and reduced coping capacity, the risk of drought has spread to all areas of the country and is affecting a broader range of people, in both urban and rural areas. Furthermore, the impacts of this hazard are predicted to increase, with the World Bank Group Climate Change Knowledge Portal, predicting the annual likelihood of Zimbabwe encountering severe drought to increase by 21% in 2040 to 2059 and by 47% in 2080 to 2099 compared to the baseline period of 1986 to 2005 scenario. </p>\r\n<p>At a national scale, droughts often result in crop failure, loss of livestock and wildlife, and power outages. The country’s worst drought occurred in 1991/2, directly affecting 5 million people and resulting in serious food insecurity and water shortages which had a ripple effect on the Southern African region compromising food security in countries that were reliant on Zimbabwe’s food exports. Repeated drought exposure has entrenched vulnerabilities and reduced the coping capacities of small-scale farmers, leaving an increasing number of people who are affected by the impacts of drought. This EAP has been developed through extensive consultation with key informants, at the community, district, and National levels, and has been supported by technical guidance from the 510 Data initiative and the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre. The monitoring of the hazard and the implementation of the Early Actions will be led by the ZRCS, guided by relevant Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ) departments, including the Agricultural Extension Department, the Veterinary Department, and the Meteorological Services Department. This EAP has also been developed with close reference to the Government of Zimbabwe National Drought Plan and aligns the identified roles of the Zimbabwe Red Cross and other stakeholders. Technical and financial support for the development of this EAP has been provided by the Danish Red Cross and Finnish Red Cross Societies. </p>",

The disruption of vaccination activities by the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of the disease which initially affected a single district in June but has now spread across all the 10 provinces of the country. Cases continue to rise and mass vaccination initiatives need scaling up to enhance coverage and reach. Most of the identified cases have not been vaccinated against measles. Risk for infection among children under 15 years remains high especially among some anti-vaccination apostolic sects. Consequently, it has led to a surge in deaths and other related complications. Measles can be a serious disease, with 30% of reported cases experiencing one or more complications. Most complications occur mostly in children and pregnant women. Measles during pregnancy increases the risk of premature labor, miscarriage, and low-birth-weight infants. Measles is more severe in malnourished children, particularly those with vitamin A deficiency. Also if not treated early, the child may develop the following: = Severe cough = Pneumonia = Blindness = Deafness = Malnutrition\nIn addition, Mozambique & Malawi have reported confirmed polio cases posing a risk of importation in Zimbabwe and the region due to high cross border movement between Zimbabwe and Mozambique, Malawi thus the health ministry remains on high alert with active screening going on across the country. The MOHCC has requested support from the Red Cross to urgently support the response across the country.",

            "description": "Tropical cyclone Eloise made landfall in Mozambique early on Saturday, hitting the coastal city of Beira with huge gusts of wind and heavy rains. Eloise made landfall around 2:30 a.m. in the morning with wind speeds of 160 kilometres per hour (kph) (99 miles per hour). The World Meteorological Organisation in a Twitter post said the cyclone had weakened to a tropical storm, and will bring heavy rains to parts of Zimbabwe, South Africa, Botswana\nAfter its landfall in Mozambique, the Eloise weather system is expected to bring heavy rains to southern Zimbabwe, northern South Africa and far eastern Botswana, according to Meteo France. In Zimbabwe, heavy rains are forecast in the southern parts of Manicaland Province as early as the evening of 22 January, with heavy rains over Manicaland Province, the southern parts of Masvingo Province expected by 23 January, potentially spreading into southern Matabeleland South Province on 24 January, according to the Department of Civil Protection (DCP) and Meteorological Services Department.\nThis is likely to cause extensive damage to roads infrastructure resulting in limited road access to the most affected people, though the extent of the need remains uncertain. Preparatory rescue and response efforts are underway, being coordinated through the Department of Civil Protection. The cyclone is also expected to hit areas that were destroyed by Cyclone Idai in 2019 and some people are still leaving in temporal structures as such DCP has initiated evacuation of these people to higher grounds (safe spaces). \nTo date a total number of 265 persons (103 households) in Manicaland have be evacuated to four (4) evacuation centres. In Chipinge and other surrounding wards near Save downstream, people are being encouraged to go to designated evacuation centres within their wards because of fear of backflow of Save river. Additionally, Covid-19 remains a threat with 4 people having been tested positive in one of the evacuations in Manicaland. Masvingo Province which lies along the path of the cyclone is also anticipating floods from the overflowing of Tokwe Mkosi Dam to that effect DCP is planning to move 250 households in Chivi District and 50 Households in Masvingo District to safer evacuation centres. In Mashonaland East Province there has been reports of damages to approximately 15 houses and road infrastructure in Chikomba District. They have also identified 6 evacuation centres, and no one has been taken to the centres yet and these are at schools in safer zones according to Civil Protection Unit (CPU). In Matebeleland South, there has being continuous rains across the province with high risk of flooding as most places were already saturated from the previous rains that have been ongoing.",

Some urban dwellings in Mutare have seen their houses and concrete walls being destructed. In Chipinge District crop fields have been submerged and excessive winds have uprooted trees resulting in roads being blocked. Daily updates from the Zimbabwe Meteorological Department indicate that the Tropical depression  has since weakened; however there will be continuous monitoring of specific areas to assess rainfall and downstream effect.  Light rains, windy and overcast conditions are projected to continue in the next 24 hours.",

            "description": "The Meteorological Service Department of Zimbabwe has issued an alert of a tropical storm which has been observed in the Indian ocean north west of Mauritius. The storm is strengthening and drifting west wards toward Madagascar. The likely path has favorable atmospheric conditions that will allow the storm to strengthen and as the storm strengthens, it will continue to move westwards. By the 26th of December 2020 it will have developed into a severe storm. Madagascar is expected  start to experience heavy rainfall, very strong gusty winds end of the week. Between first and second of January 2021 the system is expected to arrive in the Mozambique channel. It may emerge from the Mozambique channel with regained strength to reach the eastern parts of Zimbabwe with disastrous consequences. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain storm, strong wind gusts and floods are expected to cause heavy humanitarian consequences exacerbated by the already existing vulnerabilities given that the  locations, still smarting from the  TC Idai, were yet to fully recover and thus have limited capacity to limit the impact of the potential events. The government has since activated response mechanism in the country to trigger preparedness activities. Extremely exposed are some families still living in tents established post Idai, these are being prioritized for evacuation by the government.  Shelter weakened already by TC idai will likely succumb and induce shelter and sanitation humanitarian needs. other sectors such as health, food, water, education will potentially be impacted. \n",

            "description": "Since the 15th of November 2020, Zimbabwe has been  experiencing rainfall, in most cases coupled with isolated storms with adversely damaging variables  such as lightning, hail, strong winds and flash flooding.  These adverse storm conditions have affected Masvingo, Manicaland, Matebeleland South as a well as Matebeleland North provinces.  True to the forecast issued by the Meteorological Services Department these damaging rains started to persist and become widespread  from the 28th of November and to date the damaging downpours have now recorded damages in Gokwe North in Midlands province. The storm has resulted in some infrastructural damage affecting roads and destroying houses leading to urgent need for humanitarian support for WASH, Shelter, NFIs, PSS and food.  Assessments are currently ongoing to ascertain the magnitude of the damage although in some places efforts are being hampered by the rains received. \nIn Masvingo Province, Masvingo city was affected and Mwenezi District were the storm was accompanied with strong winds which uprooted trees and drenched property inside most homes on the 25th of November 2020. Some were left with no food as the roofs were blown away exposing the food items to heavy rains and others were left injured while trying to escape. In some cases, households were left with nothing as their houses were destroyed to the ground and they are currently being assisted by neighbors. These emergencies are expected to escalate in the next weeks as torrential rains have been forecasted to persist in the next 8 days, usually this induces flooding and collapse of houses and toilets as the ground gets saturated. \n\n  \n",
