        "summary": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On 29 December 2020 at 12:19 PM CET (11:19 UTC), a devastating earthquake of 6.2 magnitude1 struck with the epicenter approximately 3 km from Petrinja, which is located some 50 km from Zagreb. The earthquake was strongly felt throughout northern Croatia and especially in Zagreb, as well as in area of large parts of Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Austria, Hungary and Italy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As a result of the earthquake on 29 December 2020, almost all buildings in Petrinja and Glina area have been damaged or destroyed, particularly those in the old historical center of Sisak as well as multilevel housing buildings in Hrvatska Kostajnica. Heavy damages to housing have been reported in outskirts of Zagreb County and Karlovac County, as well as in the center of Zagreb City, where the buildings already damaged in March 2020 earthquake.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>As of 6th January</em>, there is currently no official data on how many houses and housing building were damaged, but according to the first estimations, there are at least 20,000 damaged buildings in Sisak-Moslavina County with damages estimated at HRK 3 billion (CHF 434,8 million) that will need reconstruction.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><em>As of 1st January</em>,<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">  </span>a total of 833 people were in temporary shelters – the number has been changing from day to day as people are coming in or moving out. According to rough estimations, at least around 2,500 families, with 6,250 family members from the area who are temporary accommodated somewhere else or are waiting for housing containers outside their houses. The CRC estimates a much larger number of people who are still in need of temporary accommodation given the number of people in Petrinja, Glina, Hrvatska Kostajnica and Sisak who refuse temporary accommodation and the number of damaged houses.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Croatian Red Cross response </strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Following the earthquake, CRC has activated the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) coordinating with neighboring National Societies to update on the situation, ongoing response and needs. CRC created in NICS software earthquake incident map and other NSs offering support also mapped available capacities through NICS for response in case of needs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In response, 176 CRC staff and volunteers joined the search and rescue operation along with firefighters, police and civil protection department, providing first aid to the people rescued from the ruins. The search and rescue civil protection teams were operating on 29 and 30 December inspecting the ruins and looking for people who remained trapped beneath them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Other CRC emergency teams arrived in the field during the afternoon of the 29 December and set up logistics and distribution points, as well as temporary accommodation. The CRC PSS team provided vital support for a family who’s missing a daughter was found dead in a collapsed building. In Sisak at the request of the local crisis headquarters, CRC teams assisted with the evacuation of the hospital, transferring COVID19 patients to Zagreb, as well as preparing part of the hospital for the reception of victims, and triage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the first 24 hours the CRC and our local branches teams reached at least some 8,000 people with search and rescue activities, evacuation and distribution of humanitarian aid in food and non-food items as well as first psyhosocial assistance.
