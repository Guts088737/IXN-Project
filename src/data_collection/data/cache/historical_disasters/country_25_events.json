            "description": "At 6 AM, the central region of the Tropical Storm was estimated at 17.3°N latitude and 77.8°W longitude, placing it about 160 kilometers southwest of Kingston, Jamaica, 405 kilometers southeast of Grand Cayman Island, and 670 kilometers southeast of Punta del Este, Isla de la Juventud. It is moving in a northwestern direction at a speed of 20 kilometers per hour.\nIn the next 12 to 24 hours, this system is expected to continue moving in a similar direction and speed, approaching Jamaica. As it progresses, it will continue to gain organization and intensity and could reach hurricane status near the Cayman Islands. Rain, showers, and thunderstorms will persist in the eastern and central regions, with the potential for strong and intense conditions in some areas. Precipitation will subsequently extend to western Cuba. The effects of wind and sea in different regions of the country will depend on the trajectory and intensity of this tropical cyclone.   The following provinces in Cuba are currently under alert due to the conditions associated with Tropical Storm Rafael: Camagüey, Ciego de Ávila, Sancti Spíritus, Cienfuegos, Villa Clara, Matanzas, Mayabeque, Artemisa, La Habana, and Pinar del Río. Additionally, the special municipality of Isla de la Juventud is also included in this alert. These areas are being monitored closely as they may experience significant weather impacts, including heavy rainfall, strong winds, and potential flooding.",

St. Kitts and Nevis began feeling the effects of this system early Friday morning 16th September with intermittent showers that grew in intensity throughtout the day. The bulk of Tropical Storm Fiona Passed to the south of St. Kitts Nevis about 2:00am Saturday morning dumping plenty rain and gusty winds. At this time, there are no reports of major damages. A flash flood warning remain in effect as the soil is alread satuated from previous systems, and Fiona is expected to dump an addutional 2 - 6 inches of rains. A more detail assessment will be conducted later when the rains subsides. Volunteers were placed on alert since September 14th after a national prestrike meeting at NEMA.</p>\n<p>Volunteers in the Sandy Point District discovered our preposition storage container had signicant leaks due to recent and heavy rains. The leaks took place in the area of the two extractor fans and a few bad spots on the roof of the container. Most of the floor area was wet but most of the stocks were protected on pallets. The stock damage were limited to 10 cases kitchen sets and&nbsp; and 1 bale x 50 blankets. An assessment of the Dieppe Bay storage container will be conducted to determine if the situation is simular. This issue was brought to the attention to IFRC via a DM meeting on september 16th and 17th 2022.</p>\n<p>Trevor Seaton, Disaster Coordinator</p>\n<p>SKNRCS&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Resulting in increased travel, school being fully opened, hotel bookings seeing better numbers than the previous month or even year. One of the immediate changes was the lifting of the 5 day test requirement for visitors entering the country. Comments came from the President of the Bahamas Hotel and Tourism Association (BHTA) Mr. Robert Sands, “This is absolutely another firm step in the right direction, particularly at this critical juncture in the recovery of our tourism industry,” said Sands.\n\nThe Covid-19 numbers continue to decrease well into the single digits for hospital admissions and deaths. This positive sign has the government and many residents feeling optimistic about the economy and life getting back to some \"normalcy\" . However, there is still an air of caution with residents and the wearing of face masks is still required. Persons traveling interisland are not required to take a Covid-19 test any longer. More sites for Vaccination and booster shots are now available with extended times and days for residents to take advantage of. \n\nAs of March 2022 the latest numbers on the vaccinated the total number of vaccinated reached 334,181 (total doses), 153,552 (one dose excluding J&J), and 163,526 (Fully vaccinated including J&J). The number continues to remain stagnant and the goal is to bring back an urgency so that residents see the importance of getting it done. \n\n",

A total of 11 volunteers participated with 4 males and 7 females and the feedback about the team was positive. \n\nAlso in March the use of the vehicles for the BAISS (The Bahamas Association of Independent Secondary Schools) hosted two days of track meets and some 7 volunteers made up of 2 males and 5 females. The final use for the month was with the Golden Wings Association and only two volunteers assisted. \n\nAnother turn around for the BRCS is the increase in First Aid classes and participants. Since the decrease in Covid-19 cases, more companies are either doing the 2 year renewal or signing up for the first time. For the month a total of 48 persons participated with 17 males, 29 females, 2 unknown and out of those numbers 7 were volunteers. \n\n",

The strengthening of the capacity within the Ministry of Health means it helps with the improvement in medical care. With the decrease in Covid-19 numbers the hospital continues to put measures in place for visitors to have a limited time to see relatives. Some of the positive effects are non-emergency surgeries have resumed and Non Covid-19 treatment being treated. For the most part, Covid-19 protocols are still being enforced with the sanitizing of hands, the wearing of masks and social distance keeping 6 ft apart. \n\nThe BRCS continues to be active in supporting the PHA (Public Hospital Authority), with the loss of one vehicle being serviced, limited service was provided. Support continues with having volunteers and staff assist at vaccination sites on the island of Abaco and Grand Bahama by working the registration desk or providing transportation for the elderly and disable.\n\nThe latest reports by the  Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in March 2022, downgraded the Bahamas from a level 4 (very high) to a level 2 (low) for its Travel Risk Advisory Rating. This information was shared by the Minister of Health and Wellness during a press conference during that month. Such a change means that travelers are encouraged to be up to date with their vaccinations and there is still a risk of contracting the virus. \n",

With the numbers decreasing and people feeling more free to move about, many are lobbying for the Government to dissolve the law of wearing masks in public. However, some things \nThat was set to change as the return of students face to face. During the month schools reopened with the same Covid-19 guidelines in place such as wearing masks, washing/sanitizing your hands and keeping 6 ft apart. The Government hopes that this would bring a sense of normalcy to the educational system and have students back in the classroom seeing that many were not showing up virtually. \n\nFor the month the number of Covid-19 confirmed cases was 37,052, the newly confirmed cases for the week ending August 27th zero, and the number of deaths 823. As of the 20th of August there were for the  vaccine total doses confirmed 359,269, people who have received one dose 160,606, and people fully vaccinated (including J&J). With a decline in positive cases so is the amount of people going out to get the jab. The numbers continue to remain low in the single digits resulting in less persons taking the shot. Also the ambulance services have been dissolved and no longer assist with Covid-19 transportation. Instead Ambulance services are mainly for events hosted by various organizations, thereby generating income for the National Society.\n\nPrior to the beginning of the school year the Minister of Health and Wellness encouraged parents to have their children vaccinated. Especially, with new vaccines coming in for children under the age of 5. Since the opening of school there have been no reported cases of Covid-19 on campuses which has been a relief for students, teachers, parents and the government. \n",
