In a normal summer year, when the average thickness of snow covering the dominant pasture reaches 12-15 cm in the steppe region, 8-10cm in the mountainous region, and 5-6cm in the Gobi region, it is challenging for animals to feed.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; background: white;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: black; mso-color-alt: windowtext;\">Dzud risk map was produced by NAMEM on November 10, more than 50 percent of the country is at high risk (9 percent at highest, 45 percent at high risk), 40 percent is at moderate, while only 10 percent is at low dzud risk.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; background: white;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: black; mso-color-alt: windowtext;\">Dzud risk is high in Gobi and Western regions due to drought, low precipitation in summer, and high frequency of snowstorms across the country. However, Eastern and Central parts of the country experienced a good summer, the risk was significantly increased due to heavy snowfall and snowstorms in early November, causing a hard winter and spring for herder communities. The current winter situation is increasing vulnerability because of weak livestock, heavy snow-covered pastures, compacted snow surface, extreme coldness, and lack of cash for herders while there is limited market to sell livestock in the high-risk dzud areas.</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; background: white;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: black; mso-color-alt: windowtext;\">As of November 30, the second Dzud risk map has been shared by NAMEM. According to the updated Dzud risk map, high-risk areas have been increased to 70% (26% is at high highest risk, 43% is at high risk), 26% is at moderate, and only 5% is at low risk of Dzud. Most parts of Uvs (west), Sukhbaatar (east), and Dornogovi (south) provinces, and some parts of Bayan-Ulgii, Khovd, Zavkhan, Govi-Altai (west), Arkhangai (central), Umnugobi (south), Dornod (east) provinces are at highest risk of Dzud.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; background: white;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: black; mso-color-alt: windowtext;\">Due to the worsening situation, the EWG has been extended to activate as an Emergency Operation Center (EOC) co-led by the Vice Minister of Food, Agriculture, and Ligh Industry including more government agencies in compliance with the SEC order on 8 December 2023. </span></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify; background: white;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif; color: black; mso-color-alt: windowtext;\">NAMEM has issued early warnings on heavy snow and dust storms that are taking place for this week in the western, central, and southern regions of the country, and the wind speed was expected to reach 18-24m/sec as of December 1.

By the end of December 2023, the risk has been increased to affect 165 soums (330 soums in total) of 20 provinces, and Baganuur &ndash; a remote district of Ulaanbaatar city is in high or very high risk of Dzud condition.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;\">In addition to that, the fuel shortage occurred from mid-November to the end of December. According to the Ministry of Energy, the shortages occurred due to the reduction of supply to restrict the electricity consumption of consumers for three hours a day in the capital Ulaanbaatar City, and 150 soums. Fuel shortages created additional constraints to the harsh winter conditions restricting transportation and even the major Mining companies were near to disfunction. For instance, the main hay and fodder producer Dornod province was unable to transport the hay and fodder supply due to the fuel outage during this period, resulting in delays of hay and fodder supply during this critical period. This led the herder communities to utilize the traditional way of transportation such as horse-drawn carriage. </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;\">According to the EOC assessment, currently, there are 60,511 herder households or 217,309 people in very high-risk of Dzud areas.

Based on the EOC assessment, there are 98 pregnant women, 1188 children under the age of 5, 580 elderly people, 220 disabled people, 589 people with a chronic underlying disease in the otor movement, and many more left residing soum center by the first week of January 2024.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;\">Considering the previous year's Dzud risk map released by NAMEM on 10 January 2018, 50% </span><span style=\"font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;\">of the country was covered by snow, where 66 soums of </span><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; text-indent: 0.5in;\">12 provinces were in Dzud risk, 41 soums of 14 </span><span style=\"font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;\">provinces in near Dzud condition, eventually resulting in </span><span style=\"font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;\">18 billion MNT<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>loss to the Mongolian economy. <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;While in 2020-2021 winter, t</span></span><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Roboto; color: #333333; background: white;\">he Dzud risk map as of 10 January 2021, indicated that over 50 % of the territory was identified with severe winter risk, while 25 % of the area is in mid-risk.

In particular, the Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) of IFRC released CHF 210,968 to assist 1,000 vulnerable herder families to prevent starvation, dehydration, and cold exposure of their livestock because of poor access to feed, water, veterinary care, and shelter.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;\">According to the 1 February 2023 Dzud risk map, 35% of the country was at very high risk of Dzud, 41% at high risk of Dzud, and over 20% was at moderate risk of Dzud.
