On 2 October, the Government of Armenia (GoA) officially requested international assistance after activating the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) on September 29. Out of 97,840 registered (some arriving person have not registered yet), 52% are female, 48% male, 18% over 60, 31% under 18, and 16% have disabilities, as well as 230 are pregnant women among the arrivals. This situation is further exacerbated by the presence of 20,000 people who were displaced during the 2020 and 2022 conflict, still requiring support, placing a significant socio-economic burden on the RA. The recent displacement accounts for 3% of Armenia's total population, posing integration and employment challenges in an already economically strained environment with 26.5% of its overall population living below the poverty line, and an unemployment rate constituting 13%.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 4.5pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">The humanitarian consequences of the escalation of hostilities require a comprehensive and sustained response. Governmental entities, non-governmental organizations, and volunteers are working collaboratively to address the pressing needs of the affected population. Recognizing the humanitarian needs, the Government of Armenia (GoA) has been mobilizing national governmental resources, as well as regional and local authorities. The GoA has invited relevant national and international organizations to support the coordination framework. Several inter-agency working groups (e.g., protection, health, CVA, food security) have been established, and are proactively attended by Movement partners.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 4.5pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">A vast majority of the people arriving hold Armenian passports/IDs, with authorities stating that access to health and social services is thereby ensured. However, there are concerns that despite the access to essential service in principle, practical access may still be a challenge with regard to service capacities. In addition, many face issues with documentation, leading to the government offering temporary identification assistance.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 4.5pt 0in; text-align: justify; line-height: normal; background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">According to the triangulation of primary data collection efforts and rapid needs assessments carried out by multiple actors, the immediate primary needs of those who left for Armenia include the provision of food, essential household items, psychosocial support, first aid and medical referrals, running helplines, and Restoring Family Links (RFL) services. Maintaining safe shelter is also a clear priority, with arriving people currently being hosted in temporary collective centers, hotels, boarding institutions, and with friends, relatives, and other types of host families. Notably, 48,649 individuals are accommodated in various shelters and settlements currently, while a minimum of 22,650 registered families will require rental support in the following 6 months. The types of accommodation range from private housing, living with host families, in hotels and pensions, to staying in collective centers (such as adapted former educational institutions and sports halls).</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"color: black; background: white;\">The Government of Armenia (GoA) sought the Armenian Red Cross Society’s (ARCS) assistance in registering persons at reception points established in Goris, Kornizor and Vayk, who arrived in the country. The ARCS has therefore played a prominent role from the onset of the immediate response, so far deploying 1,500 dedicated staff and volunteers, for the response operation. Alongside registration, ARCS distributed food and essential household items at reception points in Southern Armenia, with an additional focus on delivering psychological first aid (PFA). At present, with no further relevant influx since the first week of October, ARCS response focusses on the distribution of food and essential household items, as well as mental health and psychological support (MHPSS) assistance, across the country. A needs assessment surveying 5,962 individuals (representing 40,887 members of their households) who reached out to ARCS for assistance, was conducted, revealing pressing requirements in several key areas: There is a significant need for safe shelter and accommodation for those arriving in Armenia, as well as support for host communities. Additionally, immediate needs such as food and essential household items require to be addressed. The expected long-term duration of displacement respectively permanent stay in Armenia, necessitates a focus on transitioning to livelihood assistance and socio-economic integration at early stage. The preference among those affected leans towards cash and voucher assistance (CVA). Furthermore, there is a growing demand for MHPSS, with psychological support ranking as a top priority. Given that 31% of the arrivals are children, addressing their educational needs is a key priority.</span></p>",

            "description": "During and after the conflict escalation in 2020, some 90,000 persons were displaced to Yerevan and ten regions of Armenia. The vast majority among them (around 88%) were women and children, while 22% were older people. UNHCR statistics indicate that around 61,000 individuals have returned since mid-November 2020. Currently, over 20,000 displaced people living in a refugee-like situation are remaining in Armenia, who are unlikely to return to their homes, of whom 11.5% are infants and young children aged 0-59 months, 24% - children aged 5-17 years, 52.5% - adults aged 18-49 and 12% - older people (50+). Approximately 16% of the refugee-like population are persons with disabilities/special needs. Based on the information from Unified Social Service, 20,139 of the mentioned 20,433 displaced people are those who have lost property and are eligible for the Government introduced cash intervention of AMD 25,000 (for men/women and pensioners) and AMD 50,000 (for the people with disabilities in the 1st and 2nd groups and children under 18). Approaching cold season is expected to put the refugee-like population in a dire financial and social situation; on the one hand, due to the increasing expenses associated with heating and the need for winter apparel, and, on the other hand, due to the inflation in the housing market, which in some regions reaches up to 3.3% compared to the prices of November 2020. Based on Statistics Committee \"Armstat\" data, the refugee-like population are likely to face increased rental expenses in the coming months. Given that the refugee-like population was already facing financial hardships before the winter season, having a hard time covering basic livelihood needs and trying to find a balance between such needs as utility payments, food and clothes, healthcare, and education costs, the imminent winter season will exacerbate those difficulties, precipitating a severe humanitarian crisis. It is also worth noting that while the host communities have played a critical role in welcoming the refugee-like population and providing shelter and livelihood support, their resources have been depleting as well. With the increased expenses associated with the winter season, their support is likely to decrease. The increasing winterization needs of the refugee-like population have been further confirmed by the continuous needs assessment and community engagement efforts of the National Society. Starting from January of this year, 3,518 people were registered for assistance by the Armenian RC's hotline of whom 90% asked for cash assistance, as most of them are renting accommodation and cannot cover all expenses, particularly during the winter season. In combination with the abovementioned factors, the Government support to the most vulnerable refugee-like groups is decreasing. Since the onset of the Conflict Escalation in the fall of 2020, the Government of Armenia, at both the national and local levels, has provided critical support to the new arrivals, including space in communal shelters and hotels and different cash assistance programs. Nevertheless, as the conflict severely impacted the displaced and host community populations in Armenia, with a significant increase in reported physical, social and mental trauma and financial challenges, the Government is increasingly facing difficulties in addressing the growing needs of the refugee-like population. The Government cash assistance program targeting the most vulnerable cohorts within the refugee-like population, including the PWDs, children under 18, pensioners, and economically vulnerable women and men, has not been assisting the target population since November 2021. Consequently, In November 2021, Government appealed to the humanitarian community, including the Armenian RC, to support over 20,000 people living in a refugee-like situation with cash assistance for the coming 3-4 months, to ensure their winterization needs are met. The government appeal was conveyed to the Movement by the Armenian RC in November 2021; notably, mid-November 2021 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Armenia made a request to the IFRC concerning the assistance required for supporting the winterization of the refugee-like population.",
