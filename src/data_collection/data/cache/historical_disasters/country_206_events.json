The initial outbreak was followed by significant fire expansion on 2&ndash;3 July, driven by high temperatures, strong eastern winds, and extremely dry vegetation. These conditions have severely hindered firefighting operations.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;\">On 4 July, the Government of Syria (GoS) issued a formal request for international assistance, leading to the deployment of firefighting teams and aerial support from Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Qatar. Despite these efforts, a renewed and extreme flare-up occurred on 11 July, further aggravated by persistent strong winds, inaccessible terrain, and the presence of unexploded ordnance and landmines.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Open Sans',sans-serif;\">Additional wildfire outbreaks have been reported in Hama and Tartous Governorates, broadening the geographic scope of the crisis. These compounded challenges have necessitated sustained national and international coordination to contain the fires and address growing humanitarian needs.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif;\">Humanitarian Impact<br>Approximately 25,000 individuals have been affected by the wildfires across the impacted governorates, while the latest estimates indicate that over 50,000 people have been exposed.<br>At least 2,000 people have been evacuated from high-risk communities, including Sheikh Hassan, Al-Shajara, Beit Ayoush, Al-Mazra&rsquo;a, and Saboura.<br>More than 127 locations across Latakia and Tartous Governorates have been affected to varying degrees, including damage to homes, farmland, public infrastructure, and essential services.<br>Over 15,000 hectares of agricultural land and forests have burned, causing widespread destruction of olive groves, seasonal crops, livestock, and beehives, further worsening food insecurity in rural areas already facing economic fragility.<br>Damage to electricity infrastructure and water networks has halted operations at several water pumping stations, resulting in water access disruptions in surrounding communities and increasing the risk of waterborne diseases and hygiene-related health issues.<br>The wildfires have also disrupted the tourism sector, eliminating a major seasonal income source for many households.<br>Firefighting efforts have faced major challenges due to rugged terrain, strong winds, and limited resources, highlighting the urgent need to strengthen national firefighting and rapid response capacities.<br>Communities are experiencing mass displacement, loss of property, and disruption of livelihoods, placing immense pressure on already fragile coping capacities, as new groups of affected families are being added to those already exhausted.<br>Under these circumstances, new categories of vulnerable families are emerging&mdash;families that were not previously among those receiving humanitarian support, necessitating an expansion of humanitarian response efforts and ongoing updates to field assessments.</span></p>",

Between May and June 2025, increased aerial activity. The presence of unexploded ordnance and remnants of past hostilities, particularly in former frontlines and border villages, continues to pose risks to both residents and humanitarian personnel. The security incidents of 8 December and March 2025 also underline the sensitivity of the area and the need for careful access coordination. While SARC teams are actively responding, movement into remote fire-affected areas requires ongoing coordination with local authorities due to access constraints, fuel shortages.</p>",

Already weakened communities in these areas are now grappling with the aftermath of a devastating earthquake that struck the region in 2023, further worsening their already dire situation.

This increase in violence has exacerbated the vulnerabilities of communities already struggling with the prolonged crisis, earthquake repercussions, economic difficulties, the recent influx of displacement from Lebanon, and direct environmental pressures in densely populated areas</span><span dir=\"RTL\" lang=\"AR-SY\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family: Aptos; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Aptos; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-language: AR-SY;\">.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-language: AR-SY;\">All governorates, especially those directly affected, are currently facing a severe shortage of humanitarian assistance and basic necessities due to the protracted crisis, which is considered one of the longest and most complex in the world. Already weakened communities in these areas are now grappling with the aftermath of a devastating earthquake that struck the region in 2023, further worsening their already dire situation. Additionally, neighboring areas previously inundated by waves of displacement are now under additional strain on their resources and services. The onset of winter has exacerbated vulnerabilities, leaving families without adequate shelter, heating, or essential non-food items</span><span dir=\"RTL\" lang=\"AR-SY\" style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; mso-ascii-font-family: Aptos; mso-ascii-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-hansi-font-family: Aptos; mso-hansi-theme-font: minor-latin; mso-bidi-language: AR-SY;\">.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-language: AR-SY;\">Moreover, the recent displacement has disproportionately affected women, children, and the elderly, increasing their needs compared to other demographics and exposing them to additional risks.

Over 1.9 million people in Gaza are estimated to be internally displaced [OCHA]. The Gaza Strip has been under an electricity blackout since 11 October 2023, and a severe fuel shortage has led to the closure of most hospitals, particularly in the north. This has increased the pressure on remaining medical facilities and resulted in a rise in medical evacuations to neighboring countries.</em></p>\r\n<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\"><em>Food and water supplies in Gaza are critically low, with only a fraction of the needed aid arriving through the borders. Humanitarian access remains highly restricted, with significant challenges including fuel shortages, communication shutdowns, and stringent restrictions. Safe passage for humanitarian aid remains key to deliver life-saving supplies.

This has disrupted access to essential services, including healthcare, which has faced over 500 attacks since October 2023.

As of 27 September 2024, at least 1640 civilians have been killed, and 8408 injured. [MoPH]. Lebanon is experiencing a multi-layered crisis, exacerbated by the ongoing conflict.

The US Geological Survey said the earthquake was centered about 33 km (20 miles) from Gaziantep, a major city and provincial capital. Tremors were felt as far away as Lebanon, Greece, Palestine, and the island of Cyprus. Another big earthquake was felt on the same day at around 1:24 pm local time, largely in the same affected areas. Aftershocks will continue to shake the area as fault lines adjust to such a huge initial tremor. There’s even a risk—albeit a small one—of an aftershock bigger than the original quake.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SARC’s analysis currently stated that Aleppo, Latakia, Hama, and Tartous are the governorates affected the most by the earthquake, and assessments in neighboring governorates are underway. According to the Syrian MoH’s recent figures, as of <strong>28 February</strong>, the number of casualties stood at <strong>1,414</strong> deaths and <strong>2,357 </strong><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">injured in affected governorates</span><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"text-align: justify; font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">. The numbers are expected to increase in the coming days. Major infrastructure damage is being witnessed and raising concerns in Aleppo, Latakia, Hama and Tartous Governorates (in the major cities and in the countryside). The extent of damage is being continuously assessed due to the wide range of affected areas by the earthquake.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The earthquake hit amid a very harsh winter with some areas in the northern part of the country hitting sub-zero temperatures, at a time when people are facing huge electricity, fuel, and water shortages.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Syrian crisis is today even more critical than ever, with a multitude of challenges that make it one of the world’s most complex humanitarian emergencies. A decade of protracted crisis and economic collapse has left more than 15.3 million people in need of some form of humanitarian assistance</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">SARC also suffered some losses and damage to their infrastructure. A warehouse in Latakia has completely collapsed and another branch building was affected. Another Primary Health Care Centre (PHC) in Hama was also affected and needed to be immediately evacuated. Some Mobile Health Units were unable to move.</p>",

            "description": "Multiple Fires have broken out around the coastal areas in Syria. Possible reasons behind these fires differ, including the warm eastern winds that are active during this time of the year in Syria, in addition at the end of the summer there are many dry herbs that burn quickly and the moisture content of the trees is less What is possible during periods of the year, in addition to the high temperature during this period, and the fire may be transmitted through farmers burning crop residues and losing control of the fire. It is not excluded that there are fires caused by human errors and the intensity of the fires increased from 8 October 2020, which included the western rural Homs governorate, the eastern rural Tartous and the northern rural Lattakia. Most of the fires were in rugged mountainous remote areas. The intensity and size of bushfires in some areas has led to the creation of their own weather systems, generating pyro cumulonimbus clouds, trapping heat and generating strong wind and lightning strikes, in turn sparking further fires. High winds have also helped the bushfires to spread, with some fires jumping over highways and roads.\nThese fires led to material and environmental damage, as the homes of a number of residents were torched, in addition to burning agricultural crops on which they depend as a main source of livelihood, in addition to burning a large part of the vegetation, forests and natural reserves.",
