            "description": "<p>Since the evacuation of Grindavik town on 10 November 2013 a series of events have happened.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Volcanic eruption occurred from 18-21 December when a fissure of of circa 4 km opened about 2 km north of Grindavik town. Magma intrusion has been constant since then in the magma chamber beneath.</li>\n<li>Evacuation was partially lifted before Christmas but only about 100 families returned while the remaining 3600 residents of Grindavik stayed at their temporary locations. The town was still considered being hazardous.</li>\n<li>On 10 January an excavator-operator fell into a sink hole inside Grindavik town. The sink hole was at least 40 metres deep with a sub-terranial river flowing at the bottom. Rescue efforts remained for two days but were cancelled Friday 12 January.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>On the night before 14 January, seismic activity spiked in the area resulting in numerous new cracks and sink holes inside Grindavik town. The town is considered extremely hazardous. Hot-water-pipes exploded inside some of these cracks.</li>\n<li>All utilities were shut off immediately in order to protect the nearby utilities plant (electricity, water and hot water). The town remains without these utilities, which causes trouble for properties as the frost is down to minus 8 degrees celcius..</li>\n<li>The town was evacuated and the Red Cross opened a shelter for the 100 evacuees at IRC National HQ. The evacuees were put into hotels where they are still being accommodated.</li>\n<li>Later that night a new eruption started just outside Grindavik. The majority of the magma flow was directed from Grindavik by a brand new protective gravel wall. A new fissure opened later that day around 200 metres from a Grindavik suburb. Magma made its way into the town and destroyed three buildings.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Temporary housing remains a challenge as many of the temporary leasing agreements that were made on behalf of evacuees expired on Monday 15 January. Around 320 families are in immediate need for longer-term housing solutions, while the remaining evacuees have found solutions by themselves.</li>\n</ul>",
