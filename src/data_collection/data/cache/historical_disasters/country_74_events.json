The fires have prompted mass evacuations and emergency responses across the nation.</p>\n<p>Experts cite rising temperatures and prolonged droughts as key drivers of increased wildfire frequency and intensity. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wildfires in Chios</p>\n<p>Chios, one of Greece&rsquo;s eastern Aegean islands, experienced a devastating wildfire outbreak starting on Sunday, June 22, 2025, which burned for several days across multiple fronts. The fires prompted mass evacuations, widespread damage, and a significant emergency response. The estimated burned area is 2,500 hectares (25 square kilometers) of forest, farmland, and low vegetation. During the operation, at least 16 villages were evacuated, including Agios Makarios, Vrontados, Chalkios, Dafnonas, and Lithi.</p>\n<p>The Firefighting Force consisted of 444 firefighters, 85 vehicles, 14 aircraft and helicopters, and reinforcements from Athens, Thessaloniki, Kavala, and Lesvos.</p>\n<p>The major fire fronts were in Kofinas, Chalkios, Agios Makarios: Initial outbreak zones with rapid spread due to strong winds, and Agios Georgios to Vessa-Lithi: Largest active front, with flare-ups continuing into late June. In Lithi, Fire reached coastal settlements, damaging homes and mastic crops.</p>\n<p>The impact was related to environmental factors, as there was a significant loss of forest and farmland; however, mastic crops&mdash;a key local product&mdash;suffered only minor damage overall. In infrastructure, there are power outages in northern Chios, especially around Vrontados. In tourism, as Hotels evacuated in coastal areas like Lithi.<br>As of June 25, the fire was nearing extinction, with only minor flare-ups remaining. Authorities remain vigilant due to high temperatures and wind conditions.</p>\n<p>Wildfires in Crete (Ierapetra region)</p>\n<p><br>The wildfire near Ierapetra, Crete, started on the afternoon of Wednesday, July 2, 2025. By the evening, the fire had already reached multiple fronts and forced mass evacuations from villages and tourist resorts along the southeastern coast of Crete.&nbsp;The fire, which began near Ierapetra, has split into three active fronts: Achlia, Ferma, and Skinokapsala.</p>\n<p>The operation involved 230 firefighters, 10 helicopters, and 46 vehicles. The gale-force winds (up to 80 km/h) and rugged terrain are complicating containment efforts. Drones and water bombers were used during the day; aerial firefighting was limited at night. Sea evacuations were prepared with the assistance of six private boats and the Coast Guard. The key affected areas were: Ferma, Katharades, Koutsounari, Kakia Skala, Achlia, Skinokapsala.&nbsp;<br>Several evacuation operations were conducted, involving both tourists and residents. The evacuations were carried out from hotels, homes, and beach resorts. People were sheltered in an indoor sports arena and relocated to hotels in safer areas. Several Homes, greenhouses, and rental properties were destroyed, as the fires reached beachfront areas, with dramatic scenes of smoke plumes over the sea. Additionally, power outages and mobile signal disruptions occurred in the affected zones.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wildfires in Attica</p>\n<p>The fire broke out in Rafina-Pikermi, on Thursday, July 3, 2025, a coastal town in eastern Attica, near Athens. Originated near Marathonos Avenue and Arionos Street, close to the village of Pikermi.<br>There were evacuations for the areas of Agia Kyriaki, Etos Steko, and Imeros Pefkos. The residents and tourists were directed to evacuate toward the Artemida sports stadium.</p>\n<p>The winds were 5&ndash;6 Beaufort (30&ndash;50 km/h), which caused the fire to jump across Marathonos Avenue. Dense pine forests, olive groves, and vineyards fueled the fire. The smoke was heavy, blanketing the area and even affecting visibility at Athens International Airport, which was temporarily closed on one of its runways.<br>The operation included 90 firefighters, 6 ground teams, 15 fire engines, 2 aircraft, and 3 helicopters.<br>Several homes were burned, and the roads were closed on Marathonos Avenue and the surrounding areas.</p>\n<p>Another wildfire broke out on July 9, 2025, in Asprochori, located in the Municipality of Oropos, north of Athens. The fire ignited in an agricultural-forest area and quickly spread due to dry conditions, threatening nearby residential zones.&nbsp;<br>In the area, over 60 firefighters, 20 vehicles, and 3 ground teams were deployed; additionally, 13 firefighting aircraft and 6 helicopters were also mobilized. Local municipalities contributed with construction machinery and water tankers.<br>This fire is part of a broader wave of wildfires across Greece, with over 55 fires reported in the last 24 hours due to drought and high winds.<br>While no official evacuation numbers have been released, the proximity of the fire to homes suggests that precautionary evacuations may have occurred. The roads, such as Agiou Konstantinou Street and parts of the Athens&ndash;Lamia National Highway, have been closed or rerouted.</p>",

By the evening, the fire had already reached multiple fronts and forced mass evacuations from villages and tourist resorts along the southeastern coast of Crete.&nbsp;The fire, which began near Ierapetra, has split into three active fronts: Achlia, Ferma, and Skinokapsala.</p>\n<p>The operation involved 230 firefighters, 10 helicopters, and 46 vehicles. The gale-force winds (up to 80 km/h) and rugged terrain are complicating containment efforts. Drones and water bombers were used during the day; aerial firefighting was limited at night. Sea evacuations were prepared with the assistance of six private boats and the Coast Guard. The key affected areas were: Ferma, Katharades, Koutsounari, Kakia Skala, Achlia, Skinokapsala.&nbsp;<br>Several evacuation operations were conducted, involving both tourists and residents. The evacuations were carried out from hotels, homes, and beach resorts. People were sheltered in an indoor sports arena and relocated to hotels in safer areas. Several Homes, greenhouses, and rental properties were destroyed, as the fires reached beachfront areas, with dramatic scenes of smoke plumes over the sea. Additionally, power outages and mobile signal disruptions occurred in the affected zones.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Wildfires in Attica</p>\n<p>The fire broke out in Rafina-Pikermi, on Thursday, July 3, 2025, a coastal town in eastern Attica, near Athens. Originated near Marathonos Avenue and Arionos Street, close to the village of Pikermi.<br>There were evacuations for the areas of Agia Kyriaki, Etos Steko, and Imeros Pefkos. The residents and tourists were directed to evacuate toward the Artemida sports stadium.</p>\n<p>The winds were 5&ndash;6 Beaufort (30&ndash;50 km/h), which caused the fire to jump across Marathonos Avenue. Dense pine forests, olive groves, and vineyards fueled the fire. The smoke was heavy, blanketing the area and even affecting visibility at Athens International Airport, which was temporarily closed on one of its runways.<br>The operation included 90 firefighters, 6 ground teams, 15 fire engines, 2 aircraft, and 3 helicopters.<br>Several homes were burned, and the roads were closed on Marathonos Avenue and the surrounding areas.</p>",

The seismic sequence has continued to increase over the previous few days. The current seismic activity is due to submarine faults in an NE-SW direction and is unrelated to volcanic activity.\nThe Greek government has taken precautionary measures for the safety of citizens on the islands of Santorini, Amorgos, Anafi, and Ios. \nThe Committees recommend avoiding gatherings in enclosed areas, avoiding approaching abandoned buildings, avoiding access to ports: Ammoudiou, Armeni, Korfu, Old Port of Fira, to proceed to the removal of dangerous elements of non-structural vulnerability in their buildings and the emptying of water in swimming pools (swimming pools), to choose safe routes when moving through the urban fabric and the provincial road network, particularly in areas with steep slopes where landslides are likely to occur and where there is a direct route away from coastal areas in the event of strong earthquakes.\nMoreover, messages via 112 was sent to the residents of Santorini, warning them of the risk of landslides due to earthquake activity and noting that access to the areas of Ammoudi, Armenia, and the Old Port of Fira in Thira is prohibited.\nIn addition, schools in Thira, Anafi, Ios, Paros, and Amorgos will remain closed until Friday, 14/02/2025.\nAs a precautionary measure, a team of the 1st Special Disaster Response Unit (EMAK) from the Fire Department, rescue dogs, two teams of the 1st Special Forestry Operations Unit, a team of drone operators and aerial rescuers have gone to the island of Santorini.\nAt the same time, many residents have left the islands and are hosting relatives on the mainland. \nHistorical Review\nHistorically, the island of Santorini has been hit by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake in 1956. \nIt was 9 July 1956, at 5:11 am, when the devastating earthquake struck. The epicenter was south of the island of Amorgos (the easternmost island of the Cyclades) in the Aegean Sea. \nThe 7.5 on the Richter scale left 53 people dead and over 100 injured, causing the volcano of Thera to erupt, which almost flattened Santorini and caused a massive tidal wave - a tsunami. \nStill, it has been listed as the biggest earthquake of the 20th century across Europe, from the Urals to Gibraltar and from Malta to Lapland. \nThe work on the main earthquake was completed by the devastating aftershock 13 minutes after magnitude 7.2.",

As from Monday 24th of January, unusually heavy snowfall has already blanketed the northern suburbs of Athens and several roads are passable only with snow chains. The lowest temperature was -5 degrees. Thousands of cars were left standed around Attika due to the heavy snowfall. Almost 1.800 cars remained stuck and around 500 drivers remained overnight on the Attiki odos motorway.  \nBecause of many trees who fell on the cables and also on the roads and the cars, the transportation stopped for several hours and in more than 25 areas electricity was cut, thus many people remained without heating. \nDue to the extremely difficult conditions, Tuesday and Wednesday was declared public holiday (except grocery stores, gas stations and pharmacies) for seven regions of Greece. \nIn the central Greece, fifteen passengers were injured when a rail transport vehicle tried to pull a train carrying about 200 passengers which had halted in heavy snow.\n\n",
