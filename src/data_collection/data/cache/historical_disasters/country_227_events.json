The disease is usually caused by Culex pipiens, a type of mosquito found in congested or dirty water.\n\nMaldives was the first in the Region to be certified as having eliminated the disease as a public health problem in 2016. To do so it sustained a mass drug administration campaign that provided at-risk communities several rounds of preventive drugs annually. This occurred alongside mosquito control efforts, as well as a greater emphasis on case identification and treatment. A robust surveillance system, meanwhile, monitored progress and provided authorities the information to better target their interventions.\n\nIn December 2023, Filariasis 25 postive cases was identified in Kulhudhuffushi City, northern province of the Maldives during a Health screening event held for Migrant communities during 01-02nd December 2023. During the screening 25 confirmed cases has been identified.  An additional case also has been identified in Greater Male' Area.\n\nIn total 607 Screening of Individuals (All Migrant Individuals) has been conducted by Health Authorities. Out of which 594 Screening was focused in Kulhudhuffushi City and 13 Screenings in Greater Male' Area. Additional Screening Activities focused towards Migrant Communities in Greater Male' Area was carried out on 23rd December 2023 jointly with Maldivian RC.  Based on the initial findings, the Government expects a nationwide spread and requirement of immediate interventions.\n\nMinistry of Health and Health Protection Agency are carrying out Screening Tests in Wider Cities across the Maldives with a particular focus on the Migrant Community. The Maldivian RC has been requested to support in prevention and community engagement in particular with vulnerable groups such as Migrant Communities (Reported 120,000 Expatriate Workers living in Maldives with expected 50,000 undocumented Migrants) as well as immediate support in the procurement of screening kits & medication required for infected individuals. \n\nAs part of the Interventions, the Government would like to target interventions in City Level Islands, on-going Construction Sites, Migrant Accommodation Blocks as currently the assumption is the outbreak within the migrant communities. \n\nThe Health Protection currently reports that the source of the disease is from migrant individuals who have travelled to the Maldives from regions where the disease is endemic, namely Bahar,Uttar Pradesh, Gopalganj and Tamil Nadu India as well as Comilla , Bangladesh.\n\nOn-going Response Efforts by Maldivian RC jointly with the Health Authorities :-\n1. MRC Kulhudhuffushi City Office has mobilized volunteers to support vector control initiatives in coordination with Kulhudhuffushi Regional Hospital to identify and eliminate mosquito breeding sites and to administer Bti to the drainages in asphalted roads. Furthermore, MRC will be roll out community engagement initiatives to create awareness on Filariasis in the community. \n\n2. MRC Male' City Office is supporting the Health Screening Activities organized by Ministry of Health and Health Protection Agency in Greater Male' Area with volunteers mobilized to support with community engagement, communication and translation support during the process. Additional community engagement and community outreach activities will be rolled out subsequently to address misinformation and prevention.",

            "description": "Filariasis is caused by a chronic mosquito-borne parasitic infection, which can lead to swelling of the extremities, hydroceles, and testicular masses. The disease is usually caused by Culex pipiens, a type of mosquito found in congested or dirty water. Maldives was the first in the Region to be certified as having eliminated the disease as a public health problem in 2016. To do so it sustained a mass drug administration campaign that provided at-risk communities several rounds of preventive drugs annually. This occurred alongside mosquito control efforts, as well as a greater emphasis on case identification and treatment. A robust surveillance system, meanwhile, monitored progress and provided authorities the information to better target their interventions. In December 2023, Filariasis 25 positive cases was identified in Kulhudhuffushi City, northern province of the Maldives during a Health screening event held for Migrant communities during 01-02nd December 2023. During the screening 25 confirmed cases has been identified. An additional case also has been identified in Greater Male' Area. In total 607 Screening of Individuals (All Migrant Individuals) has been conducted by Health Authorities. Out of which 594 Screening was focused in Kulhudhuffushi City and 13 Screenings in Greater Male' Area. Additional Screening Activities focused towards Migrant Communities in Greater Male' Area was carried out on 23rd December 2023 jointly with Maldivian RC. Based on the initial findings, the Government expects a nationwide spread and requirement of immediate interventions. Ministry of Health and Health Protection Agency are carrying out Screening Tests in Wider Cities across the Maldives with a particular focus on the Migrant Community. The Maldivian RC has been requested to support in prevention and community engagement in particular with vulnerable groups such as Migrant Communities (Reported 120,000 Expatriate Workers living in Maldives with expected 50,000 undocumented Migrants) as well as immediate support in the procurement of screening kits &amp; medication required for infected individuals. As part of the Interventions, the Government would like to target interventions in City Level Islands, on-going Construction Sites, Migrant Accommodation Blocks as currently the assumption is the outbreak within the migrant communities. The Health Protection currently reports that the source of the disease is from migrant individuals who have travelled to the Maldives from regions where the disease is endemic, namely Bahar,Uttar Pradesh, Gopalganj and Tamil Nadu India as well as Comilla , Bangladesh. On-going Response Efforts by Maldivian RC jointly with the Health Authorities :- 1. MRC Kulhudhuffushi City Office has mobilized volunteers to support vector control initiatives in coordination with Kulhudhuffushi Regional Hospital to identify and eliminate mosquito breeding sites and to administer Bti to the drainages in asphalted roads. Furthermore, MRC will be roll out community engagement initiatives to create awareness on Filariasis in the community. 2. MRC Male' City Office is supporting the Health Screening Activities organized by Ministry of Health and Health Protection Agency in Greater Male' Area with volunteers mobilized to support with community engagement, communication and translation support during the process.
