            "description": "<p>Yemen still reaps the shocks of heavy rain and flooding that hit several governorates of the country, causing many fatalities, infrastructural destruction, and movement of thousands of families. These floods started at the end of August 2024 and massively affected both urban and rural areas, including governorates like Al Hodeidah, Al Mahwit, Hajjah, Taiz, Al-Jawf, Ibb, Dhamar, and Ma'rib.</p>\n<p>Severe climate-related events affected some 3,500 households between the 28th and 30th of August in Al Mahwit and Dhamar provinces, with 800 families displaced. This situation confirms the new challenges from climate change and increased vulnerability of Yemeni communities to freak weather occurrences. Floods have clogged most roads, bringing to a halt transportation of supplies. \"The situation is dire, with no end in sight to the rainfall,\" said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.</p>\n<p>The human cost of the flooding has been immense. At least 38 fatalities were recorded in Milhan District, Al Mahwit, and at least 25 people have died in Wsab Alsafel District, Dhamar. Rescue and relief activities have been severely affected due to landslides and floods cutting across roads and separating already vulnerable communities. This comes after the destruction of infrastructure, including the collapse of homes and blockage of roads, which worsened the already dire humanitarian situation.</p>\n<p>Disaster struck Al-Mahwit on August 28 after three strategically placed water reservoirs blew up into pieces. The first one, which was the largest and located on a mountainside, blew open first, which, in turn, caused the other two tanks to disintegrate below it. That chain of events even further endangered the local population by destroying homes and flooding the Wuljah market, an essential source of livelihood for so many people. Water contamination, the damage of health centers, and house destruction left hundreds of families stranded, taking refuge in temporary shelters and left to the task of rebuilding their lives.</p>\n<p>Heavy rain and floods, since August 29, 2024, caused damage across the country of Yemen, affecting some of its governorates. Some 34,284 households are now affected by the floods, with large damage in some areas. The worst-affected governorate was Hajjah, where 18,380 HHs were affected, and Al Hodeidah, where 2,459 HHs were affected, with big damage reported. In Al Maharah, 2,293 houses were damaged and 1,838 houses in Hadramawt. Other affected Governorates include Ta'iz with 5,761 and Ma'rib with 2,524 houses damaged. The least affected are the Governorates of Ad Dali' (49), Amran (29) and Raymah (142).</p>\n<p>Hundreds of homes have been destroyed either partially or totally, thus displacing families and leaving them without shelter. Besides the property losses, many households are losing livestock, further enhancing the economic burn of these already poverty-stricken communities. The floods affected 23 wells, which left the people without access to clean water&mdash;a very essential resource in such emergencies. This has equally resulted in the damage that has left vulnerable populations without access to medical care, hence deepening the humanitarian crisis.</p>\n<p>The consequences of this flood would only multiply the sufferings of the communities affected all over Yemen. Displacement of families, water sources being contaminated, and the disruption of health services are among factors that urgently require both immediate and long-term humanitarian response. Sustainable interventions should be put in place to preclude future disasters of such scale, including, among others, rebuilding of critical infrastructure and addressing climate-induced vulnerabilities.</p>",

Yemen is prone to recurrent seasonal flooding which results in displacement, disruption to livelihoods, a spike in water-borne diseases, loss of crops, and property damage. In 2022, climate-related events triggered a 93 percent increase in new and secondary displacements, concentrated in Al-Hodeidah, Al-Jawf, Marib, and Ta&rsquo;iz governorates.

            "description": "As a result of armed conflicts in some districts of Marib governorate, the governorate witnessed internal and external displacement to neighboring governorates such as Shabwa and Al-Bayda, and this greatly affects the daily life of the population and the displaced people, all of this increases the difficulty of life for the vulnerable and poor groups in the region, and it greatly affects the psychological state of children and women. \nAccording to the estimation of the YRCS Marib Branch, the number of new IDPs at Marib governorate reaches 1800 HHs, the needs of these displaced families are concentrated in the fields of food, shelter, WASH. According to the YRCS Shabwah branch Report, the number of new IDPs from the Marib governorate is 172 HHs.\nIOM’s Displacement Tracking Matrix (DTM) – which currently has access in seven of Ma’rib’s 14 districts – recorded the displacement of close to 10,000 people last month, the highest rates recorded in Ma’rib in a single month this year.\nFrom 01 January 2021 to 23 October 2021, IOM Yemen DTM estimates that 14,195 households (HH) (85,170 Individuals) have experienced displacement at least once\nThe situation is also dire in Harib, Al Jubah, and Rahabah districts, from where nearly 4,700 internally displaced persons (IDPs) are estimated to have fled this month. The majority went to safer areas in Al Jubah and Ma’rib Al Wadi districts, and to densely populated, urban areas in Ma’rib city.\nArms conflicts in parts of neighboring Shabwah also caused the displacement of hundreds within that governorate and north into Ma’rib.\n",

The roads are bumpy at the entrances to Mukalla, especially the old Al-Dis Mukalla and the Hyper Company, which caused the accumulation of stones and dirt, and the citizen could not cross.\nAt least 40 cars were swept away by torrents and (several) homes were damaged, _ While about 60 of people were injured while driving and some of them were inside cars, while a young man died of electric shock\nSo far, there is no displacement in places such as schools and others. There is a displacement of families between relatives. The number is 5 families from the Al-Dis district, 6 families from the old Mukalla, and 3 families from the Al-Sharaj area.\nThere is a need for road maintenance, such as cleaning, etc., and shelter materials such as mattresses and pillows for most families who have been displaced with relatives, and to provide food materials to the number of affected families, and to provide first aid supplies.\nThe Yemeni meteorologist announced, on Tuesday/Wednesday night, that expectations indicate that 6 governorates in the country will be affected indirectly by Cyclone Shaheen.\nThe Weather Forecast and Early Warning Center of the Meteorological Authority in Aden said, that \"after the evasion of Cyclone Shaheen on the Omani lands, it is expected that Yemen will be affected by a state of atmospheric instability from the remnants of moisture left by the cyclone, accompanied by rains.\" \nAncient buildings in Yemen's Hadhramaut province were damaged by intense rainfall and flooding caused by Cyclone Shaheen.\n",

            "description": "During hours on Wednesday (21-07-2021 ),the governorates of Shabwa and Al-Mahra witnessed heavy rains, which caused torrential torrents in reefs and valleys.\n\nAccording to the sources, the torrential rains since Tuesday(20-07-2021) evening have caused the death of five people in Shabwa and two in Al-Mahra Governorate, while searches for missing persons are still ongoing.\nIn Hadhramaut Governorate, heavy rains flooded individual areas of the districts of the valley, causing road blockades and significant property damage, while helicopters intervened to evacuate stranded people in Seiyun District.\nHeavy rains caused severe mudflows in the Shabwah province in the southeast of the country.\nThe National Meteorological Center had called on Yemenis to stay away from torrential streams and valleys as a result of the depression in a number of Yemeni governorates.\nWhere there is still an opportunity for sporadic moderate to heavy rain over most regions of Yemen, the heaviest in the governorates of Sa’ada, Hajjah, Amran, Al Mahwit, Raymah, and the western districts of Sana’a and Dhamar governorates, accompanied by thunderstorms sometimes, hail showers and active winds that raise dust and dust on desert areas. It is also expected that these rains will be heavier on Friday afternoon.\nThe activity of the southwest monsoon continues on the islands of the Socotra archipelago, where winds reach 40 knots with strong gusts of up to 50 knots that disturb the sea and raise the waves.\nWarnings and Warnings:-\nThe National Center of Meteorology warns citizens in areas where rain is expected not to be in torrents and valleys, which people used to cross by means of transport and to take the necessary precautions against rockslides and mudslides, especially in roads and hilly bends, and from the decrease in the horizontal visibility due to the heavy rain, low clouds and fog in order to preserve their safety and their property.\nThe center also warns the fishermen and sea-goers around the Socotra archipelago and the eastern Gulf of Aden against the turbulence of the sea and high waves.\n\n",
