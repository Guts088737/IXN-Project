            "description": "The wildfire began in the forest area nearby Arakapas village (LImassol) in the afternoon of Saturday, 3 July 2021. Because of the high winds, the fire got out of control burning the village to the ground and spreading to nearby villages. \nThe Government deployed all available firefighting squadrons, while the Civil Defence Service initiated Plan \"Hephaestus\" in order to coordinate all efforts to put down the fires. The Government immediately asked for help from Greece, Israel and Egypt. With their help (8 firefighting aircrafts), the fires were contained on Monday morning. \nThe fires burned 80 houses in 8 villages, left 1431 persons displaced (temporarily housed in hotels), 4 persons dead, a whole chicken farm of 80.000 chicken, many other farm animals, and several enterprises totally burned.  \nThe President of the Republic, the Minister of Interior and the Minister of Agriculture and the Commissioner of the Citizen, visited the affected areas and announced measures in order to reconstruct the villages, the forests and the lives of the persons affected. The Government vouched to offer financial and physiological aid to all victims of the fires.\n\nThe final estimation of burned land is 67km2, including Natura areas, while the financial damage is estimated at €110 millions. \n\nSince the first day, NGOs, civilians (either individual or in teams), volunteers and Organisations visited the affected sites and provided aid and services to the persons affected. On 7 July 2021, the Civil Defence Director announced that all short-term needs were covered for the time being.",

        "summary": "On 20 May 2021, the Minister of Interior, Nikos Nouris, sent a letter to the European Commission informing it that Cyprus cannot withstand further migration flows and therefore the country is entering in a state of emergency. A series of events, starting from March 2020, led to the declaration of the state of emergency. Since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, Cyprus has experienced many periods of lockdowns and relaxation measures. The consecutive lockdowns and movement restriction measures, with the latest lasting from 26 April to 10 May 2021, had inadvertently affected the arrival trends of migrants. On 10 May 2021, the Government decided to gradually stop the lockdown and consecutive restrictions, so that normalization could be achieved until June 2021. At that time, the Government’s Advisory Scientific Group of epidemiologists predicted that the country will have successfully accomplished herd immunity against the Novel Coronavirus (65% of population vaccinated with at least the first jab). As expected, the relaxation measures caused an influx of migrants directly from Syria by boats, and also over other routes, which caused enormous pressure to the already overcrowded reception system. As of November 2020, the First Reception Centre in Pournara (Kokkinotrimithia) ran over maximum capacity, restricting the exit of newly arriving migrants – caused by the increased flow as well as the change of the origin of people arriving, as explained below. This also concerned the new arrivals who could provide an address where the Asylum Service could reach them, which was a prerequisite for their exiting until that point. In certain cases, several migrants were confined inside the Centre for over two months and tensions broke out due to overcrowding. As an example of the increased flow of people, since the relaxation measures began, 4 boats arrived within two weeks-time with 274 persons, which was a new record in the country’s migration trends. Moreover, before 10 May 2021, the checkpoints between the Government controlled areas and the non-Government controlled areas were closed because of the lockdown, therefore, migrants arriving from Turkey were stuck for a long time at the northern non-Governmental controlled areas and in Turkey. With the easing of restrictions, the flow of people has increased via this route also. While the Government officials are still struggling to release the migrants who were restricted in the Centre before May 2021, the Reception Centre currently hosts more than 1,800 migrants, meaning that it is running 125% over max capacity, hosting part of the population in tents next to the centre. Meanwhile, the Kofinou Accommodation Center is full as well, with almost 400 migrants and more than 50 staying in the quarantined area nearby the Centre as of 7 June. Concerning the noted delay of examining new asylum applications, the Minister clarified that the country’s authorities are overwhelmed with rejected applications.",
