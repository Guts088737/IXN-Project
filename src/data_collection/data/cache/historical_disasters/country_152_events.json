        "summary": "<p>General elections are scheduled in Sierra Leone from June to July 2023 following the calendar issued by the Electoral Commission for Sierra Leone (ECSL). This election includes, first, a Presidential election and a Parliamentary process across the country. The Election campaign started in 2022 and was completed in May 2023. There have been indicators that social or civil unrest would likely be experienced during the election period, requiring heightened readiness of the National Society to support potentially affected communities under its mandate.</p>\r\n<p>The coming elections will be held as follows:</p>\r\n<p>• 24th June 2023 Presidential - voting day in the 16 districts of the country.</p>\r\n<p>• 25th to 28th June 2023, Proclamation of the results of the presidential election. This is an estimated date based onhistorical process which usually takes up to 4 days.</p>\r\n<p>• Proclamation of Parliamentary representative following the Proportional representative system established in early 2023. The date for the start and end of this is not specified but all election processes must be completed from June to July. Following the NS contingency planning, a period of two weeks is estimated for planning purposes.</p>\r\n<p>With regards to the upcoming 2023 General Elections period, incidences of inter-communal conflict have so far been observed in many parts of the country. Indeed, these elections will be held against the backdrop of a severe complex economic crisis and periods of civil unrest surrounding governance issues. In the period leading to the election, the country has witnessed civil unrest, economic instability, currency devaluation, and multiple disasters, especially in the country’s capital city, Freetown. The widespread protest of August 2022 was a violent example of turmoil in Freetown and other cities in Sierra Leone. Indeed, thousands of protesters mobilized around the country, blocking roads and main supply routes demonstrating unemployment, economic hardship, and injustices, demanding reductions in fuel prices, economic relief for indebted families, fair prices for agricultural products, employment and labour rights, security, and protection. Over 34 people were injured, 30 deaths (including 3 police officers), and many detained in different parts of the country. These events are analyzed to be the reflection of what could happen during the upcoming general elections. Moreover, some recent analyses report that ahead of the June 24 poll, a rematch of the 2018 vote, identity issues and economic stagnation are also on the ballot. After the change of the Parliamentary voting system in early 2023 from a complete election system to a Proportional representative system. Proportional Representation is a type of electoral system under which subgroups of an electorate are reflected proportionately in the elected body. This could add more expectations from the population on the Presidential elections, given that level of changes in the presidential votes may also lead to parallel changes of the National and local possible representatives across the country. The hope for politico-economical changes is highly expected based on some allegations and past analysis reporting a high corruption level across the country with some economical challenges not resolved.</p>\r\n<p>The period preceding the elections (until late March) has seen episodic protests and reports of intimidation against opposition parties. This and the intimidation actions already reported against the opposition indicate that the relative calm reported in other sources can also deteriorate. Between the most recent event, there has been members of the opposition wounded or shoot and some violence in the past weeks since the campaign. Whilst the priority is to support peacebuilding and prevention of violence efforts, previous outbreaks of violence have demonstrated the importance of planning for potential humanitarian response activities.</p>",

The fire left 409 people injured, including children among heaps of burned-out rubble that used to be their houses. Some children are feared to be injured or separated from their families due to this fire incident.\nIt is noted that many children have not been able to go to school as a result of the loss of their school properties in the crisis. At the moment, thousands of families at Susan’s Bay already live in desperate conditions as they lost everything they had including their makeshift shelters, their clothes,  food they had in stock, money and other valuable properties are all gone. The National Disaster Management Agency has established a joint team comprising of partners (Agencies and Humanitarian organizations) to lead and undertake a joint in-depth assessment of the situation and provide technical and coordinating leadership to immediately respond to the incident.",
