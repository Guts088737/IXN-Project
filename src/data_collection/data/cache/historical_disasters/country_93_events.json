The team divided into 4 groups (case investigation, social investigation, environmental screening and secretariat). Findings/report will be shared on 3rd August 2024.\nKey issues of concern include:\n•\tFrequent stock out of some vaccine antigens leading to interruption of immunization efforts\n•\tHigh population/congestion in the reception center (over 7,000 against capacity of 4500pax) and the camp (74,382 against capacity of 63,000).\nMost new arrivals do not come with immunization documents from county of origin which becomes challenging to initiate vaccination; assumption is that not documented, not done. As a result, health workers may have to treat these individuals as unvaccinated or under-vaccinated, potentially repeating vaccinations unnecessarily.\n•\tMost new arrivals are under vaccinated and unvaccinated, this status increases the risk of vaccine-preventable diseases spreading within the camp.",

The adverse effects of these weather events have been significant, with over 316,038 people displaced and more than 284 displacement camps formed countrywide. The floods have damaged infrastructure, affected 64 health facilities, and cut off communities, hindering access to essential health services. Sanitation facilities have been compromised, and sources of clean water have been contaminated, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases. In Tana River County, 10,576 households have been affected, with 6,448 households being displaced. A total of 88 displacement camps with an approximate population of 15,556 people have been formed in Tana River County. In Siaya County, 419 households were affected, and among them, 107 households were displaced.",

This number is projected to rise to 2.8 million by June 2025 if the MAM rains perform poorly. Malnutrition rates have reached alarming levels, with 800,202 children under five and 120,732 pregnant and breastfeeding women requiring immediate nutrition interventions. Social vulnerabilities have also escalated, with 842 cases of child marriage, 2,985 teenage pregnancies, and 2,451 children engaged in labour due to worsening economic conditions as per the national SRA report 2025. Families have increasingly resorted to negative coping mechanisms, such as reducing meal portions, withdrawing children from school, and engaging in risky survival strategies.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify; margin: 12.0pt 0in 12.0pt 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Aptos Display',sans-serif; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Aptos Display'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Aptos Display';\">Projections indicate below-average long rains for MAM 2025, and the outlook remains dire.

The onset is also scheduled to be delayed, so in some areas, it will only have light showers in February and then pause all the way to mid-April with occasional dry spells.

This has resulted in flooding and flash floods in 37 counties, displacing 63,619 HHs across the country and compromising sanitation facilities and clean water sources, thereby increasing the risk of waterborne diseases such as cholera. Among the counties most severely affected are Wajir, Garissa, Mandera, Lamu, Tana River, Homa Bay, Migori and Isiolo. More than 58 health facilities across the country have been impacted, with some rendered inaccessible due to damaged roads, marooned individuals, and infrastructure destruction. Outreach sites in Tana River and Lamu were also impacted reducing accessibility to health care services.  As of 25 December 2023, a total of 200 Cholera cases and 4 fatalities have been reported in Tana River and Lamu County. Diarrheal cases are still being reported in the community since most people cannot access safe and clean water.",

The Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) indicate the <strong>rains are expected to peak in November but may continue into January 2024</strong>. From beginning of November, the first regions to experience significant and widespread floods were the Northeastern, Eastern followed by the Coastal. The riverine and flash floods have so far caused more damage and displacement. As the floods materialized, KRCS started their response actions immediately. But other regions are now also reporting flood events.</p>\r\n<p>KRCS carried out an aerial survey on 7 Nov and confirmed that several areas remained inaccessible due to the floods and damaged roads, particularly in Mandera County. The extent of floods spread to 37 counties with most affected areas being the Northeastern of the country. While the impact of the rains has been building since early October, signicant impact to which the KRCS mobilized a national response started from 3 Nov with heavy rains, flash floods, and increasing river levels that have caused fatalities, displacement of thousands of people, damage of infrastructure, loss of livestock and property, and restricted access to roads in various regions of the country. The rains have washed away homes and rendered roads impassable leaving thousands homeless. The loss of lives, extensive damage to property, and disruptions in infrastructure underscore the urgency of the situation.</p>\r\n<p>Areas of particular concern include <strong>Mandera, Garissa, Wajir, and Tana River, in northern Kenya</strong>, where communities have long displayed resilience in the face of water scarcity and hunger during droughts.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Impact as at 6 December</strong>:</p>\r\n<p><strong>37 counties</strong> are affected by floods.</p>\r\n<p><strong>130,198 households affected</strong> of which <strong>59,002 households </strong>are <strong>displaced</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>It's reported that there are <strong>143 fatalities</strong>, <strong>240 people injured</strong> and <strong>38 are missing</strong>.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Livestock, agriculture, infrastructure:</strong> 17,287 livestock deaths, 18,394 acres of farmland destroyed. WASH and road infrastructure have also been damaged or destroyed in some affected areas. Local health facilities, schools and other public places have been submerged in water in some of the affected counties.</p>",

        "summary": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: black;\">Tana River basin constitutes one of the main river basins in Kenya. Over lower Tana basin, floods have previously been experienced, adversely affecting the communities resulting in humanitarian crises in the years 2013, 2015, 2018 and 2020 according to the Kenya Flood EAP. For this reason, the Kenya flood EAP covers this and two other basins (Nzoia and Athi). On July 4, 2023, the World Meteorological Organization declared onset of El Nino. The phenomenon is known to enhance seasonal rainfall over Kenya and most parts of the world. In August 2023, the Kenya Meteorological Department (KMD) issued the October to December seasonal forecast for Kenya that emphasized on above average seasonal rainfall expected, driven by El Nino coupled with a positive Indian Ocean Dipole. The rainfall season began peaking in the last week of October. Since the onset of the season in October, the season is exhibiting rainfall that lately, has abruptly been filling up the river channels. Throughout this period, KRCS has been monitoring the risk of flooding. On 02 November, a flood wave was observed over Garissa Bridge— the first gauging station over lower Tana. The water level at this point reached 4 meters, a level that has been earmarked as alarming, for which the discharge overtops the riverbanks leading to flooding further downstream. The level is red-marked by the Water Resources Authority in Kenya to serve a flood alarm over the river basin.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: black;\">A flood wave observed at Garissa Bridge takes about 48 hours to reach the next station (Hola) in the downstream. By November 4th, water levels at Garissa had surpassed 5 meter mark— bordering the highest mark of the river gauge while the levels at Hola have reached alarm level. Additionally, rainfall forecast for the current week1 indicates Kenyan central highlands are expected to continue receiving heavy rainfall. The flood wave is expected to begin overtopping riverbanks along the lower Tana as heavy rains continue to be experienced over central highlands and other Tana basin source regions. At this time, streamflow forecast at Garissa Bridge from GLoFAS model remain low, under the 1-in-2 year flood. While the GLoFAS forecast is the trigger as per the Kenya flood EAP, caution is taken not to ignore the observed imminent flood at this time. But we choose to proceed with activation of the flood Early Actions despite GLoFAS’s miss of this flood wave. We recognize analysis of the GLoFAS skill over Tana basin was relatively low with about double False Alarm Ratio (at 0.5) compared to performance of the model in other basins. The low forecast skill in GLoFAS is likely related to lack of assimilation of observed data.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: black;\">2 conditions for activating the flood EAP have been met: </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: black;\">a) A threshold for extreme flood has been met at Garissa Bridge and Hola giving creating anticipation of floods in the next few days </span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: start; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; color: black;\">b) Short range forecast indicates that heavy rainfall is expected to continue accumulating over the source region of River Tana.</span></p>",

Recently, over 20,000 new arrivals have been registered with more than 10,000 recorded in the first quarter of 2023. The majority are mainly from South Sudan, with some citing drought, flooding, and food insecurity among their reasons for flight in addition to conflict and insecurity. In Kitale Transit Centre, an estimated 1,700 asylum seekers have been recorded as new arrivals with no refugee status. The centre is only able to hold 200 people resulting in over-stretching of the available planned resources where the asylum seekers are now hosted in Kitale Agriculture Society of Kenya (ASK grounds). As a result, the reception centres in both Kakuma camp and Kalobeyei settlement are holding more than their capacity, leading to congestion and posing serious health risks. There has been a discussion with the authority in Kenya as to whether register or take back those in transit and a decision has not yet been made since 23rd April hence resulting in the over-stretching of humanitarian needs in both Kakuma Refugee Camp, Kalobeyei and Kitale Transit Centre.</span><span style=\"font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;\">Daadab Refugee Camp</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-US\" style=\"font-family: 'Verdana',sans-serif; mso-bidi-font-style: italic;\">Somalia continues to face the longest and the most severe drought in its recent history, due to the failure of five consecutive rainy seasons, with a sixth failed rainy season predicted. Reduced access to water and the ever-shrinking pasture have affected pastoralist and agrarian communities throughout the region, forcing them to leave their places of origin in search of water, food, pastures, or humanitarian assistance. More than 1.3 million Somalis have been displaced internally due to drought since 2022. According to the UNHCR-led Protection and Return Monitoring Network (PRMN), 234,000 displacements within Somalia were recorded in February 2023. Out of the total displacements during the reporting month, the majority, 62% were attributed to conflict/insecurity, 34% due to the drought, and 4% due to other reasons.

        "summary": "<p>The IFRC Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) has approved a total of CHF 499,199 for the Kenya Red Cross. The approved amount consists of an allocation of CHF 135,978 for readiness and prepositioning and CHF 363,222 allocated to implement early actions once the defined triggers are met. Allocations are made from the Anticipatory Pillar of the DREF, under the DREF appeal code MDR00001. Unearmarked contributions to the DREF are encouraged to guarantee enough funding is available for the Early Action Protocols being developed. This Early Action Protocol (EAP) is a tool to guide the timely and effective implementation of early actions. These actions are informed by specific weather or climate forecasts and biophysical indicators predicting and/or indicating drought events. If such events materialise and no proper actions are in place, they have a high likelihood of generating a humanitarian crisis. Humanitarian crises can be avoided or minimised by the joint and timely action of the Government of Kenya at National and County level, communities at risk, stakeholders including the Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS), United Nations Agencies, Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) and Development Partners. This EAP has been designed by KRCS in collaboration with the National Forecast-based Financing Technical Working Group (TWG) composed of key actors in disaster risk reduction (DRR) and disaster management (DM). All the stakeholders involved in this plan are members of the TWG and have a key role during the preparation and activation of EAP. The climate in Kenya ranges from tropical (in the coastal region) to arid (in the mountain regions). There are two main rainy seasons; the March-April-May (MAM) \"long rains\" season and the OctoberNovember-December (OND) \"short rains\" season. The occurrence of droughts in Kenya is not a rare event, since 80% of Kenya is composed of arid and semi-arid land (ASAL) with annual rainfall ranging from 200 to 500 mm resulting in periodical droughts that are part of the climate system. In the past, communities were able to cope with the periodic droughts and had developed resilience to drought events. However, local observers report that an intensification in both the length and severity of these events has been observed in the last few decades. This perception is confirmed by the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWSNET) analysis that monitored and mapped rainfall trends over 50 3 years between 1960 and 2009, revealing that \"long rains in central Kenya have declined by more than 100 millimetres since the mid-1970s\" (FEWSNET, 2010). Columbia University - International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) data also affirms this decline in the long rains. Haile et al. (2019) reports that severe droughts have already hit the country (e.g. 2017) and over the recent years have become more frequent, long lasting and more severe. The impacts of drought are felt hardest in the agricultural sector which is the backbone of Kenya's economy. Agriculture contributes to food security, employment and economic development of the country (e.g., ROK, 2010). According to UNDP (2012), the sector contributes 26% directly to the annual GDP and 26% indirectly through industries that feed from the sector such as wholesale, retail sales, agro-based manufacturing and transport. Further, it contributes 65% to total exports from the country and 16% to formal employment. The sector employs about 80% of the rural population (World Bank; CIAT. 2015) who rely on small-scale (3ha units) subsistence farming, livestock rearing and fishing (IFAD 2019). With regards to historical drought impacts recorded in Kenya between 1973 and 2022, food insecurity, loss of livelihood, crop failure, disease outbreak, disruption of education, water scarcity, increased cattle rustling, and conflicts are the most reported impacts (Figure 1). The magnitude of these impacts have been found to vary across different counties in Kenya. From the analysis, high drought risk was in the Northern Kenya Counties of Turkana, Marsabit, Samburu,West pokot, Wajir, Mandera and Tana River. Other Counties in eastern and southern Kenya with relatively high risk include Narok, Makueni and Kwale.</p>",

This comes after an alert forwarded by the Ugandan government to Kenya in line with the East African Community Health Protocol. The outbreak of EVD in Uganda poses a significant threat to the country as the frequency of Ebola outbreaks in Uganda has taken a unique pattern in recent times. The current outbreak is vigorously spreading and has a high case fatality (20.9%).</p>\r\n<p>Kenya carries out routine surveillance with zero reporting on Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHFs) for the moment. This is an acknowledgment of the risk of EVD outbreaks that the country faces as it has similar vulnerabilities to Uganda.

            "description": "The food security situation has been on a worsening trend in the Arid and Semi-Arid (ASAL) counties in Kenya attributed mainly to the poor performance of the October-November-December 2020 short rains and the March-April-May 2021 long rains. Both seasons were characterized by late onsets, below average cumulative quantities, and poor distribution both in time and space. This has resulted in worsening drought conditions manifested in poor vegetation conditions, increased distances to water sites in 78% of ASAL counties, worsening livestock body conditions and reduced milk production in 9% and 61% ASAL counties respectively (NDMA Bulletins, May 2021). \nAccording to NDMA drought bulletin for July 2021, twelve (12) counties of Marsabit, Mandera, Garissa, Wajir, Kilifi, Tana River, Lamu, Samburu, Kitui, Lamu, Isiolo and Laikipia are in the alert drought phase, while eleven (11) counties including; Nyeri (Kieni), West Pokot, Baringo, Embu, Kajiado, Kwale, Meru, Narok, Taita Taveta, Tharaka Nithi, and Makueni are in Normal drought phase. The worst affected counties are Turkana, Garissa, Wajir and Marsabit counties which have about 5% of their populations in IPC 4 (NDMA, July 2021). During the month under review, fourteen (14) counties reported a worsening trend. Based on the NDMA July National monthly drought updates, KRCS launched a full drought operation on 2 August 2021 to support response to immediate effects in the ASAL Counties.\nThe trend of Mid Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) – used to measure acute malnutrition- has remained stable and on improving trend, however the following counties namely; Mandera, Tana River, Marsabit Turkana and Wajir have MUAC above long-term average. The observed long-term negative trend in malnutrition of the five counties was attributed to reduced milk consumption owing to a decrease in milk production and fewer number of integrated health outreaches delivering essential nutrition services in these areas. \nTrekking distances to and from water sources for both livestock and communities, have increased significantly especially in Samburu, Isiolo, Mandera, Tana River, Turkana, Mandera, Wajir, Garissa and Baringo counties. \nPasture and browse conditions are poor with Marsabit, Turkana, Kilifi, Tana River, Isiolo and Samburu counties among the worst affected, where pastoral livelihood zones are at alert to alarm phase, trending to a worsening situation. Selected sub-counties in Kilifi (Rabai and Kilifi South sub-counties), Isiolo (Isiolo North and Isiolo South sub-county) and Garissa (Lagdera sub-county) counties are experiencing severe vegetation deficits (VCI) following poor performance of the March-April-May 2021 rains season (NDMA, July 2021 bulletin). In addition, Marsabit, Wajir, Samburu, Tana River, Laikipia, Kitui and Kwale counties are experiencing moderate VCI, trending towards a worsening situation.  Diminished forage resources have triggered migration and concentration of livestock in particular dry season grazing areas. Diminishing resources increases competition for the resources, which is a major trigger of resource-based conflicts if not managed early enough.\nMost areas that have started experiencing food insecurity are in the ASAL areas in Kenya, where communities practice mainly agro-pastoralism and pastoralism and thus depend mainly on meat and milk for nutrition and income. The food insecurity situation in some counties has been compounded by sporadic cases of conflicts, particularly in Baringo county where a conflict and an ongoing security operation has disrupted community livelihoods. Other counties where conflicts have been reported include, Marsabit, and Isiolo counties. The conflicts have resulted in displacement of communities as well as loss of lives and livelihoods. Disruption of markets has also been noted further limiting communities’ access to income and food. \nAccording to the latest report by the NDMA, the total projected population of people in need of assistance is estimated to reach 1,913,265 people between July to December 2021.\nIn response to the current drought, KRCS has continued to support affected communities since March 2021, when IPC 3 outcomes were noted from assessments in the affected areas and following requests for support from a number of counties. The intervention is targeting at least 24,000 Households in Marsabit Garissa, Mandera, Wajir, Isiolo, Turkana, West Pokot, Kitui and Baringo with in kind food distribution, CVA, Health and WASH services.\nKRCS has already reached 42,284 people with food distribution, (6,300hh in Marsabit, 1,166hh in Wajir and 5,803 hh in Tana River) over 835.87 metric tonnes of food distributed and 500hh (Approx. 3000 people) in Turkana & Marsabit reached with CVA under the desert locust intervention- IFRC DREF. \n",

            "description": "Since the beginning of the month of May, most parts of the country have recorded moderate to heavy rainfall as predicted by the Kenya Meteorological Department forecast of 3 May 2021. Isolated storms and strong winds have also been reported in parts of Upper Eastern, North Eastern and Coast Regions. An increase in frequency, intensity and consequent effects has been recorded this month (May) as compared to April. According to the current weather outlook released on 10 May covering (11th -15th May 2021), Heavy rainfall (more than 30mm within 24 hours) is expected over some parts of the Highlands West of the Rift Valley, the Lake Victoria Basin, the Central Rift Valley, the Northwest, the South-eastern Lowlands, the Northeast and the Highlands East of the Rift Valley (including Nairobi County). Strong southerly to south-easterly winds with speeds exceeding 25 knots (12.9 m/s) are expected over some parts of the Coastal Strip and the Northeast Kenya.The rains are likely to result to more effects to population in the high risk Counties of West Kenya and Coast region.\n Rainfall effects have so far been reported in 13 counties. The latest counties to report effects are Siaya, Migori, Homabay and Nakuru Counties. A general increase in river water levels has also been recorded across the country especially in West Kenya Region where rivers Nzoia, Kuja, Sondu Miriu and Nyando have been reportedly swollen in the last 72 hours. \nIn Siaya, 2 girls (4 and 13 years) lost their lives and an elderly man was injured after their houses collapsed owing to heavy downpour accompanied by strong winds at Usenge area in Kisumu County. In Migori, 5 Primary Schools (Nyora, Agungo, Sere, Modi and Tulu) in Nyatike Sub County did not open for third term yesterday as expected after raging waters rendered the five institutions inaccessible. \nIn Homabay County, 337 HHs have also been displaced by floods owing to rising level of Lake Victoria. Simbi Primary School and a health center in Rachuonyo Sub County have been marooned leading to suspension of learning and provision of health services. \nA major part of Nakuru County’s road transport has been paralyzed disrupting movement and livelihood activities for at least 500Hhs after a key bridge connecting Michinga and Marioshoni areas was swept away. \nThe Coast Region has received light rains in the last week. Water levels in River Tana are at 2.7 meters and expected to rise to spill level and subsequent effects if the ongoing heavy rains continue to be recorded in the Central Kenya highlands. \nSince the onset of the March April May rains, 8 fatalities have been recorded, 6,040 HHs displaced and 4,700 acreage of agricultural land destroyed across the country.",

The forecast also indicated that the Lake Basin region, parts of the Highlands East of the Rift Valley (including Nairobi county), the Highlands West of the Rift Valley, parts of the North-West, the Southern Rift Valley and Central Rift are to experience enhanced rainfall.The forecast also predicted mid-March as onset and mid-June as cessation dates of the rains.\nThe rains commenced as predicted in various Counties of West Kenya including Busia, Homa Bay, Kisumu, Kakamega, Siaya and Migori Counties which received above average to heavy rainfall. Central Kenya Counties including Muranga, Kiambu, Nyeri, Meru, Embu,Laikipia and Nairobi also received moderate to heavy rains which resulted to impacts in informal settlements of Nairobi and lower River Tana basin leading to displacement of 13,840 people and submerging of 3,232 acres of agricultural land due to flash floods.The affected families' houses were rendered inhabitable and some destroyed. They also lost most of their household items and foodstuffs as stored stocks and unharvested crops were washed away.The displaced are residing in makeshift camps and some have been integrated with other families.",

            "description": "The food security situation has been on a worsening trend in the Arid and Semi-Arid counties in Kenya, with the situation expected to persist into May 2021 as a result of below-average short rains harvest and declining livestock body conditions (Fews Net, Food Security Outlook, February 2021). The worsening conditions are attributable to the average to below rainfall received especially in Arid and Semi-Arid counties during the October-November-December 2020 rainfall season. \nAccording to the Kenya Food Security Steering Group (KFSSG) short rains assessment, conducted in February 2021, 1.4 million people in arid and semi-arid areas are facing Crisis (IPC Phase 3) or worse outcomes (1,185,600 people in IPC 3 and 238,600 people in IPC 4), an increase of 93 percent compared to the preceding long rains season and are in need of urgent life-saving support. The same assessment estimated that 412,066 children between 6-59 months old acutely malnourished and in need of treatment.\nCurrently, three (3) counties (Turkana, Marsabit and Mandera) are Alarm phase of food insecurity (IPC3) with a further seven (6) ASAL counties (Baringo, Isiolo, Kilifi, Garissa, Wajir and Tana River) are in the Alert Phase (IPC 2) and trending towards a worsening situation (NDMA bulletins for Feb, 2021).\nIn Marsabit, Turkana and Mandera counties which are currently the worst affected counties as indicated above, hot and dry conditions continued to persist with many areas experiencing highly depressed rainfall. Consequently, the three counties are facing acute water scarcity and the pasture and browse conditions have continued to diminish. \nThe declining forage and water resources have resulted in declines in livestock productivity, atypical migration to dry land grazing areas, and conflict over pasture and water sources.\nLivestock deaths have been reported in parts of Turkana and Marsabit counties, mainly caused by opportunistic diseases, dehydration and starvation with some of the affected sites being Kalapata (Naaguro), Kalokol, Lakezone (Nachukui), Lokori (Kaaruko), Lokichar (Kapese) in Turkana county and Dukana in Marsabit county.\nThe nutrition situation has also deteriorated especially in Marsabit, Turkana, Mandera, Isiolo, Wajir, Samburu and Garissa counties, where the nutrition situation in selected sub-counties is at Phase 4 (Critical). The main drivers of extreme critical acute malnutrition are poor dietary intake due to relatively poor performance of short rains and disruption of livelihood activities due to COVID-19. Other drivers included morbidity, poor childcare practices, poor sanitation and health environment coupled with other pre-existing vulnerabilities such as high levels of poverty.\nThe worsening food insecurity has also been exacerbated by the locust invasion with swarms reported in 24 counties in the country the worst affected being Marsabit, Turkana, Mandera and Wajir counties where vast areas have been affected by locust swarms. With the upcoming March to May long rains, mature swarm invasions are expected to persist in northern and parts of southeastern Kenya, with hopper invasions in coastal areas (FewsNet, February 2021 update). The desert locusts will thus continue to pose a serious threat to crop and forage production in affected areas further negatively impacting the food security situation.",

The County Director of Public Health of Mombasa made a request for support to Kenya Red Cross on 26 April 2021 and the Chief Officer, Medical Services &amp; Public Health, County Government of Lamu, on the 28 April 2021. In both counties, the cases are on the rise and urgent action needs to be taken to prevent an all-out outbreak which would endanger the lives of the population causing a health disaster. Public health officials are warning that more cases should be expected as the seasonal ‘long rains’ run through to the end of May, boosting mosquito populations. The scenario is that if this spread of Dengue is not addressed urgently, it will spread into adjacent counties.</p>",

            "description": "According to the Kenya Red Cross Society rapid assessment reports, the conflict between Pokot and Turkana communities escalated by 15th January 2021 to a level that threatened safety and security of the residents in the Baringo County bordering Turkana County. The conflict led to 26 houses burnt down, killing of 10 people among them 3 police officers and approximately 1,500 families displaced as they flee from conflict torn villages prompting the Government to declare a full security operation to restore peace and order. \n\nThe security operation led to more combat between the police and bandits with increased casualties with gunshot wounds, more people fleeing away from the conflict area and fear of police brutality. Due to fear of insecurity, many markets and shops/businesses in the area have closed down and the Government has introduced a 6pm to 6am curfew and mounted several road blocks on major roads in the area to limit movement of people. Some community water points have also been vandalized, schools and health facilities closed due to insecurity. The resulting situation as at the time of this field report is approximately 1,500 people displaced from their homes due to loss of their shelter burnt down or fleeing from insecure areas and putting up with neighbours far from the conflict area but cut off from access to basic commodities and supplies. The displaced population are in need of basic survival commodities like food and emergency health services to the injured and awareness on COVID-19, a giant pandemic that is still active in the country to avert looming serious humanitarian complex crisis.",
