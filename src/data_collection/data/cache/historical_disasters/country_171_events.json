            "description": "~ Tonga government is advising everyone to continue remaining indoors to avoid inhaling volcanic ash - especially elderly &amp; children - wear masks &amp; eye protection if need to be outdoors ~ Water board has tested water supplies &amp; drinking water is safe ** FAFÁ ISLAND update - Fafá team and their families are safe - extent of the damage unknown But it does appear structures on the western side of the island ‘have all been claimed by the ocean’ ** FONOI, MANGO &amp; TUNGUA are being tagged as ‘completely wiped out’ with their structures, however the Hall on Tungua is intact &amp; acting as the shelter accomodation ** Half of NOMUKA wiped out These islands as well as Atata are or have been evacuated ** Ha’apai - another Tongan Maritime vessel was dispatched today to the group with more medical, water &amp; essential supplies - some injuries &amp; injury count unknown ~ “All agriculture is ruined” - Tonga's Speaker of the House Lord Fakafanua ~ All government departments back operational today ~ Mobile network was expected to be established using the University of South Pacific's satellite dish today, though the connection would likely be limited and patchy : MFAT report 19 Jan (12:45 PM): * 2G has not been restored overnight. Digicel remains hopeful to stand up a very limited connection this morning. Once restored the connection will be limited and patchy covering approximately 10% of usual capacity and prioritising voice and SMS communications only. Initial testing has indicated that current international voice connectivity is one way only – i.e. NZ calls into Tonga are being received and heard in Tonga but voice connectivity is not working the other way – so calls or responses back from callers in Tonga cannot be heard in NZ. Wantok won’t be able to establish connectivity until the NZDF consignment arrives on the C-130. Australia will also be supplying equipment on fist flights out from Brisbane as they are coordinating with Digicel &amp; Telstra * US cable company SubCom has advised that the best case scenario is four weeks for the cable to be repaired, with the repair ship expected to arrive in Tonga 1 February. ~ Humanitarian aid &amp; disaster relief supplies are on board - The HMNZS Wellington (has Navy hydrographic and dive personnel to survey changes to shipping channels &amp; a Seasprite helicopter to assist with supply delivery) &amp; The HMNZS Aotearoa (bulk water supplies) - Both ships left NZ yesterday &amp; are expected in Tongan waters Friday ~ HMAS Adelaide is expected to depart Brisbane tomorrow[?] Its loaded with humanitarian / disaster relief supplies, plus critical equipment to help recovery efforts 〰️ the ship will serve as a base for relief work ~ Clearance of the runway at Fua’amotu International Airport - hopefully the amazing manual ash clearance will be completed today to allow the 1st NZ &amp; Australian C130 Hercules flights of relief supplies to proceed tomorrow ~ Another Orion flight departed NZ today to undertake further surveillance of Tonga and to also capture imagery over the southern Lau group of Fiji",
