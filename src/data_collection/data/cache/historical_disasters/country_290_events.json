White Nile as other regions of Sudan that are already characterize by a complex humanitarian condition that this projections is likely to worsen. \nThe scale of the floods in 2019 to 2022, the Sudan crisis displacement in Norther South Sudan cumulate with ongoing climate related disaster, food insecurity and precarity of humanitarian sectors in general put the South Sudanese communities in an extreme vulnerable situation for the upcoming floods events.

Critical infrastructure <br>has been severely damaged, cutting off supply routes and leaving communities without access to essential services <br>such as healthcare and education for displaced people. The risk of disease outbreaks, particularly cholera and malaria, <br>has increased significantly. As of 11 February 2025, the number of suspected cases of Cholera has risen to 29,304 <br>cases with 501deaths, and a case fatality rate (CFR) of 1.5%, justifying the RC/RC Movement mobilization and <br>underscoring the urgent need for further action. Mayom County (northwest of Rubkona, Unity State) has in the past <br>few days become the top hot spot with cumulative cases at 585 and CFR of 8.4 %, while Rubkona has recorded overall <br>the highest number of cases during the outbreak (over 10,000). Cholera cases have now been reported in 30 of the <br>80 counties in the country and across seven states and one administration area. Especially in rural areas, poor <br>surveillance outside of health facilities and on the other hand poor access to care are contributing to underreporting <br>and deaths that could be prevented through community-based interventions. Misconceptions and lack of awareness, <br>coupled with poor water and sanitation infrastructure are also contributing to harmful practices, adding to the spread <br>of Cholera in vulnerable communities. Children are the most affected population with ages 0 to 4 years at 32.5% of <br>cases followed by 5 to 14 years at 22.8% of cases 2<br>. Oral Cholera vaccination (OCV) campaigns have taken place in <br>hotspot areas, with 1,400,000 people vaccinated (out of a total of 3,200,000 doses) as of 22nd of January 2025.

This humanitarian crisis is now compounded by a cholera outbreak originating in Sudan’s border areas, which has steadily spread across South Sudan. The epidemic has taken hold in key hotspots, including Upper Nile, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, and Unity States, with cases reported in Jonglei and Central Equatoria. Among the returnees, refugees, and host communities, aggravated malnutrition has further heightened vulnerability, creating the perfect storm for rapid disease transmission.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"EN-CA\" style=\"font-family: 'Calibri Light',sans-serif; mso-ascii-theme-font: major-latin; mso-hansi-theme-font: major-latin; mso-bidi-theme-font: major-latin; mso-ansi-language: EN-CA;\">South Sudan faces a complex and worsening humanitarian crisis.

Poor infrastructure and limited access to services mean many cases of illness and disease go unreported, particularly in rural areas. The situation is further exacerbated by the high concentration of people in transit centers and the continuous movement of returnees and refugees to various locations, significantly increasing the risk of disease spread. Overcrowded conditions in camps for internally displaced persons (lDPs), refugee settlements, and places of detention compound these challenges, placing already vulnerable populations at greater risk. This convergence of crises underscores the urgent need for coordinated and comprehensive interventions to save lives and curb the outbreak.</span></p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"https://prddsgofilestorage.blob.core.windows.net/api/emergencies/7082/20241129_affected_map.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"900\" height=\"596\"></p>",

Some 16 suspected cases are also currently admitted at hospital, with a cumulative 1,110 contacts of which 668 are being followed-up.</p>\r\n<p>During the last National task force meeting, it was highlighted that a case had moved from Mubende to Kampala and died in Kiruddu hospital in Kampala, prepared by family members and repatriated back to Mubende for burial.</p>\r\n<p>There is spread of the virus across Uganda, reaching the Capital city, which has major transportation route into Juba, with daily traffic for economic and cultural reasons. This means there is need to ensure readiness of Red Cross Teams and provide communities with much needed information on how to prevent the spread of EVD.</p>\r\n<p>The rapid spread of EVD in Uganda with a case fatality rate of 35%, coupled with the fact that there is no vaccine yet for this lesser known strain of the Ebola Virus, are the main reasons for South Sudan RC to revamp its preparedness work. In addition, since the 2018-2019 trainings, volunteers trained in SDB, RCCE and other key EVD preparedness and response pillars have not received refreshers which are now much needed. This will help to restructure the various teams for community surveillance and case detection.</p>\r\n<p>Suspected cases were detected in South Sudan on 30th September and declared negative after testing at the Juba Teaching Hospital. However, given the porous borders between Uganda and South Sudan, and the regular economic and cultural exchanges, it is uncertain how long it will be before a case is declared, or if a case will be declared. This is the main reason it is necessary to ensure readiness and preparedness in a speedy manner.</p>",

            "description": "South Sudan is facing flooding in 6 regions/states one of which is under drought DREF support since June 2021. The government together with UN OCHA have reported that more than 400,000 people have been affected so far with a projection of the number doubling in coming weeks. IGAD has released a warning that the country will continue to record an increased rainfall over the coming weeks and this will worsen the already dire situation. \n\nThe United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said thousands of people have been affected by flooding in areas along the river Nile, Sudd wetlands and the Lol and Sobat rivers since May this year.\n\nThe affected regions include Unity, Jonglei, Northern Bahr el Ghazal, Warrap, Upper Nile and Western Equatoria. The hardest hit areas are in Unity State, where a total of 149,000 people are affected, and Jonglei with 134,000 affected, according to OCHA. OCHA said early seasonal rains caused rivers to overflow their dykes and banks, flooding vast areas and settlements, with more heavy rains and flooding expected in the coming months. Many of the flood-affected people moved to higher grounds within their county, and plan to return home once the flood waters recede.\n\nThe SRCS together with other in country humanitarian partners are responding to the needs of the flood-hit communities and providing essential supplies such as food, emergency shelter, WASH services and hygiene kits, health and nutrition supplies and services, protection services and dignity kits, and fishing kits for livelihood support.\n\nCoordination meetings for movement partners have been held and identified the current IFRC DREF support will not be sufficient to meet the emerging needs of the affected areas. Rapid assessments and delivery of life saving interventions have been hindered in some areas due to limited access. ICRC will be supporting the NS with logistical support.",

Indeed, the food security situation in South Sudan has reached unprecedented crisis levels. According to its Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) projections, an estimated 5.8 million people (48 per cent of the population) faced Crisis levels of food insecurity (IPC Phase 3). In March 2021, OCHA in Situation Report No. 5 already estimated that an overall 810,000 people were in Crisis or worse levels of food insecurity (IPC Phase 3+) across the entire country, according to IPC projections. This included over 300,000 children suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM) and some 480,000 pregnant and lactating women who are acutely malnourished and in need of treatment.</p>\r\n<p>The situation in the country is reported to be the highest levels of food insecurity since independence, 10 years ago. The worsening conditions are attributed to the prolonged flooding, ongoing violence, displacement and COVID-19 pandemic, the impact which has eroded the livelihoods and coping strategies of the vulnerable communities across the country. On 8 June 2021, the Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs and Disaster Management (MHADM) requested support from South Sudan Red Cross, to provide food and water to affected populations in the six priority counties highlighted.</p>",
