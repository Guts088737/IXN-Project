            "description": "<p class=\"p\" align=\"justify\">Benue and Plateau states in Nigeria are experiencing one of the most protracted and deadly communal conflicts in West Africa. The farmer-herder conflict, rooted in land use disputes and increasingly complicated by criminal violence and impunity, has persisted for over 24 years. The intensity of recent attacks, particularly from late March to June 2025, has reached catastrophic levels.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p\" align=\"justify\">In Benue State, 23 out of 23 LGAs have reported violent attacks. Recurrent assaults in Ukum, Logo, Gwer West, Gwer East, Katsina-Ala, Agatu, and Apa LGAs have led to the displacement of over 450,000 people (IOM Nigeria, June 2025 Displacement Matrix Report). More than 200 villages have been destroyed, with schools, health centers, boreholes, and markets deliberately targeted and rendered inoperable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p\" align=\"justify\">In Plateau State, between 27 March and 2 April 2025, five communities in Bokkos LGA (Daffo, Gwande, Hurti, Manguna, and Ruwi) suffered coordinated armed attacks. The Plateau Peace Building Agency confirmed that 167 rural communities have been attacked in the last two years in Bassa, Barkin Ladi, Bokkos, Jos East, Jos South, Mangu, Riyom, and Wase LGAs. Over 65,000 people have been displaced (UNOCHA Nigeria, May 2025 Situation Overview).</p>\r\n<p class=\"p\" align=\"justify\">A notable incident occurred on June 14, 2025, when suspected herdsmen killed 200 people in Yelwata, Guma LGA (Benue) and displaced 2,000 others (Benue State Emergency Management Agency, BSEMA, June 2025). Just six days later, 32 more civilians, mostly women and children, were killed in renewed violence in Mangu and Bokkos (Plateau State Government Situation Brief, June 2025).</p>",

Recently, the leader of one of the AOG issued a violent ultimatum to Bafarawa village, warning residents to evacuate within 48 hours or face attack. This marks a pattern of threats and violence similar to previous assaults in neighboring areas.&nbsp;<br>Several Villages are affected by the attacks, including Makira, Shabanza, Katsalle, Dan Kura, Garin Tunkiya, Dama, Dan Tazako I, II, and III, Gaugai, and several others.<br>Humanitarian Impact&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Displacement:<br>Thousands of families have been forced to flee, with many now taking refuge in overcrowded IDP camps. These makeshift shelters lack food, clean water, clothing, sanitation, and medical care. Families are living in open spaces, mosques, schools, and markets, exposing them to weather extremes and heightened security risks.</p>\n<p>Sexual Violence:<br>Numerous incidents of rape, especially of underage girls and married women&mdash;have been reported during night-time attacks. Survivors remain without access to trauma counseling, reproductive healthcare, or legal aid.</p>\n<p>Health Crises:<br>All health centers have either been burned or abandoned. Diseases such as malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections, and urinary tract infections are widespread. Vaccines are unavailable due to the collapse of cold-chain systems, and essential drugs are scarce. Pregnant women and children under five are particularly vulnerable.</p>\n<p>Food Insecurity:<br>Farms have been deserted, food stocks looted, and markets shut down due to fear and insecurity. There is no food assistance in any affected area, increasing the risk of mass starvation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "summary": "<p>There has been displacement in some communities in Isa LGA in Sokoto state as a result of an ultimatum issued by one of the OAG leaders to leave the communities on the allegation that they are providing information to the government forces.<br>Since early 2022, Isa LGA has witnessed a dangerous increase in armed insurgent activity. Recently, the leader of one of the AOG issued a violent ultimatum to Bafarawa village, warning residents to evacuate within 48 hours or face attack. This marks a pattern of threats and violence similar to previous assaults in neighboring areas. <br>Several Villages are affected by the attacks, including Makira, Shabanza, Katsalle, Dan Kura, Garin Tunkiya, Dama, Dan Tazako I, II, and III, Gaugai, and several others.<br>Humanitarian Impact </p>\r\n<p>Displacement:<br>Thousands of families have been forced to flee, with many now taking refuge in overcrowded IDP camps. These makeshift shelters lack food, clean water, clothing, sanitation, and medical care. Families are living in open spaces, mosques, schools, and markets, exposing them to weather extremes and heightened security risks.</p>\r\n<p>Sexual Violence:<br>Numerous incidents of rape, especially of underage girls and married women—have been reported during night-time attacks. Survivors remain without access to trauma counseling, reproductive healthcare, or legal aid.</p>\r\n<p>Health Crises:<br>All health centers have either been burned or abandoned. Diseases such as malaria, diarrhea, respiratory infections, and urinary tract infections are widespread. Vaccines are unavailable due to the collapse of cold-chain systems, and essential drugs are scarce. Pregnant women and children under five are particularly vulnerable.</p>\r\n<p>Food Insecurity:<br>Farms have been deserted, food stocks looted, and markets shut down due to fear and insecurity. There is no food assistance in any affected area, increasing the risk of mass starvation.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

            "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On the morning of 24th June, following heavy rainfall, the Trademore Estate and its surrounding estates (Efab, Pyakassa road, Sahara, Promenade) experienced a flood disaster with many buildings(mostly the buildings towards the estate gate) submerged up to window level, including a police station, pharmacies, schools, shops, and residential buildings. The access roads connecting the estates and the exit gate of the Trademore estate were overrun with flood water thereby disrupting the flow of traffic. &nbsp;The flooding in the estate has been a perennial occurrence every rainy season which made the FCDA plan for the</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">demolition of some structures in the estate which was disrupting the natural water flow. The demolition was halted when those residing in the estate protested and got a court ruling to stop the demolition stating that the recurrent flooding in the estate was largely caused by the channeling of water into Trademore by the adjoining estates.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">These estates are built on the flood plains along the river channel that runs adjacent the estate and also indiscriminate dumping of refuse in the already narrow water channel are a contributing factor to the flood. It is also important to note that there is a dam upstream from which water is released at intervals.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Annually, this area experiences flood, some severe and some are mild. This is due to its geographical location &ndash; closeness to a river.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>During the Assessment after the water receded:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">It was noted that there is a school with up to 500 students including their teachers and management on the flood plain.

            "description": "The Lassa Fever outbreak in Nigeria keeps escalating with a cumulative 4, 726 cases since week 1 of 2024. Sadly, 142 deaths have been recorded so far and 31 healthcare workers have been affected in 27 states including the FCT.\n\nThe worst affected states are Bauchi, Taraba, Edo, Ondo, Plateau, Benue, Cross River, Rivers, Anambra, and Ebonyi States with 123 Local Government Areas. Although Lassa fever disease is endemic in Nigeria, a case fatality rate (CFR) of 18.5% has raised a lot of concerns, especially around late diagnosis and reporting which has led to increased fatality.\n\nComparing the present situation with the 2023 outbreak, the number of suspected cases in 2024 has progressively increased (4,726) compared to that reported for the same period in 2023, which was 3, 361.\n\nThe National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Incident Management System has been activated to coordinate response at all levels at the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC). So far, the response has been coordinated through 8 pillars namely: Coordination, Research, Risk Communication, Surveillance, Case Management, Logistics, Laboratory, Infection Prevention and Control and Safe burial.\n\nThe NCDC has highlighted the following as major challenges and gaps in response-\n\nLate presentation of cases leading to an increase in CFR\nPoor health-seeking behavior due to the high cost of treatment and clinical management of Lassa fever\nPoor environmental sanitation conditions observed in high-burden communities\nPoor awareness and lack of community engagement in high-burden communities\nPoor IPC measures among health workers especially at the Primary Health Care level\nInadequate Psychosocial services to the community health workers who have rejected patients as a result of fear of infection and consequently death.\nIn recognition of the grassroots presence and the strength and capacity of the Red Cross in community engagement, active case search, and health promotion, the Government is requesting the Red Cross support to bridge the gap in response, enhance community awareness, and promote early detection and presentation of cases to reduce the mortality rates and improve health and wellbeing.",

            "description": "<p class=\"p\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Effects of the Hazard</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p\" align=\"justify\">Lassa fever is a viral infection carried by the multimammate rat&nbsp;<em><span class=\"15\">(Mastomys natalensis)</span></em>, one of the most common mice in equatorial Africa found across much of sub-Saharan Africa. The illness was first discovered in Nigeria when two missionary nurses got infected with the virus in 1969. Its name is derived from the village of Lassa where it was first documented. Lassa fever is predominantly reported in Sierra Leone, Liberia, Guinea and Nigeria but, because of the&nbsp;<em><span class=\"15\">Mastomys</span></em>&nbsp;rat's high prevalence in neighbouring countries, these areas are also at risk. Once a&nbsp;<em><span class=\"15\">Mastomys</span></em>&nbsp;rat is infected, it can excrete the virus in its urine, potentially for the rest of its life. This makes the spread of the disease worryingly easy when added to the fact that this species, like other rats, breeds easily and inhabits human homes. <strong><span class=\"16\">The most common method of transmission is the consumption or inhalation of rat urine or faeces, through food and/or water. Lassa fever can also be spread through cuts and open sores. </span></strong>Because the rats live in and around human habitation, they often come into contact with foodstuffs. The rats themselves are sometimes eaten and the disease can be spread during their preparation. Person-to-person transmission is possible via blood, tissue, secretions or excretions, but not through touch. Lassa fever can also be passed between patients and staff at poorly equipped hospitals where sterilization and protective clothing is not standard.</p>\n<p class=\"p\" align=\"justify\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Current Situation and affected population</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Cumulatively from week 4, 2024, 48 deaths have been reported with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 18.6 % which is higher than the CFR for the same period in 2023 (17.9%) In total for 2024, 18 States have recorded at least one confirmed case across 60 Local Government Areas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Seventy-two (72%) of all confirmed Lassa fever cases were reported from these three states (Ondo, Edo, and Bauchi) while 28% were reported from 15 states with confirmed Lassa fever cases. Of the 72% confirmed cases, Ondo reported 25%, Edo 24%, and Bauchi 24%.The predominant age group affected is 21-30 years (Range: 1 to 98 years, Median Age: 31.5 years). The male-to-female ratio for confirmed cases is 1:1.The number of suspected cases increased compared to that reported for the same period in 2023. One new Healthcare worker was affected in the reporting week 4. National Lassa fever multi-partner, multi-sectoral Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) activated to coordinate the response activities at all levels on the 14th of January 2024.</p>\n<p class=\"p\" align=\"justify\">With the increasing number of Lassa fever cases reported from several States across the country, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) which is the coordinating agency has activated the National Lassa fever Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) for coordination of response. A letter of notification of Lassa fever EOC Activation has also been sent to 36 states and FCT to activate the state EOC. The NCDC is collaborating with the World Health Organization (WHO), Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Irua Specialist Teaching Hospital, African Field Epidemiology Network, US Centres for Disease Control and other agencies, in supporting the response in the affected States.</p>\n<p class=\"p\" align=\"justify\">&nbsp;</p>",

            "description": "CSM is an epidemic–prone disease with infections reported all year round across Nigeria. The disease is caused by acute inflammation of the coverings of the brain and spinal cord and weather conditions like the dry season with dust, winds and cold nights aided by overcrowding, poor ventilation and frequent upper respiratory tract infections increases the risk of contracting the disease. Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, a thin layer of the connective tissue that covers the brain and the spinal cord. If due to an infection, this inflammation can be caused by a variety of organisms - bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi. Injuries and certain drugs can also cause such inflammation. Bacterial meningitis is of significant public health importance because; It has a high morbidity and mortality, can be epidemic prone depending on the type of bacteria, and is both treatable and preventable.\nThe CSM disease can affect persons of all ages and gender. Cumulatively Epi-Summary as at 31st December 2023, a total of 115 suspected cases including 16 deaths (CFR 13.9%) have been reported from 15 states in this 2023/2024 CSM season. A total of 37 samples were collected (32.17%) from 115 suspected cases from beginning of the outbreak, and 12 cases confirmed (32% positivity rate). The 5 -14-year-old age group was the most affected and 53% of the total suspected cases were Males. Eity-two percent (82%) of all suspected cases were from five (5) states – Jigawa (53 cases), katsina (21 cases), Oyo (15 cases) and Kano (5 cases). Eighteen LGAs across four states, Jigawa (11), Katsina (4), Oyo (2) and Kebbi (1), reported more than two suspected cases each in 2023/2024 CSM season.file:///C:/Users/user/Downloads/An%20Update%20of%20Meningitis%20Outbreak%20in%20Nigeria_210923_38.pdf",

        "summary": "<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The severe malnutrition crisis in northeast Nigeria has been exacerbated by ongoing conflict, displacement, and limited access to essential<br>services. Children are particularly vulnerable, facing heightened risks of morbidity and mortality. The healthcare system, already strained<br>by high demand, is struggling to cope with the escalating needs, highlighting an urgent need for increased support and intervention to<br>address the malnutrition emergency.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>Humanitarian organizations in northeast Nigeria have issued urgent warnings due to a dramatic surge in malnutrition among children in<br>Borno, Adamawa, and Yobe (BAY) States. Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) which is leading the case management pillar of the Nutrition<br>cluster in Nigeria, has observed a significant increase in admissions of severely malnourished children with life-threatening complications<br>across seven northern Nigerian states, including the BAY states, with some areas experiencing admissions double those of 2023.<br>The BAY states' nutrition sector reported a 63 percent increase in admissions of children with complicated severe acute malnutrition<br>(SAM) between January and April 2024, compared to the same period in 2023. The worsening nutrition situation has overwhelmed the<br>healthcare system, with bed occupancy rates reaching 100 percent well before the expected peak of the lean season.<br>According to the UNOCHA report, In April 2024 alone, MSF admitted 1,250 severely malnourished children with complications to its<br>inpatient therapeutic feeding centers across the BAY states. This number is double the admissions recorded in April 2023. By the end of<br>May 2024, MSF's facilities in these states were accommodating 350 patients, far exceeding the 200-bed capacity initially set for the peak of<br>the lean season, which spans from June to August.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>In addition, Nutrition surveillance data from April among displaced populations from remote and hard-to-reach communities in the BAY<br>states revealed an alarming 18 percent prevalence of SAM and Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM) among children aged 6-59 months.<br>The data also indicated a 1.2 percent increase in the overall prevalence of malnutrition and a 0.9 percent increase in SAM cases among<br>children compared to March 2024. This trend underscores a critical and deteriorating nutrition situation that requires an immediate and<br>collaborative response.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>Since January, humanitarian partners in the BAY states have been providing either food or cash transfers to support displaced people<br>living in camps or with host communities, as well as vulnerable host populations. With diminishing resources, partners have reached over<br>1.1 million vulnerable people with food assistance out of 4.8 million in need this lean season. Despite the alarming situation, the overall<br>humanitarian response remains inadequate. Funding for the ongoing humanitarian response in the BAY states remains a major<br>challenge. As of 12 June, the 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan, which needs $926.5 million, is only 20.5 percent funded. The nutrition<br>sector has reported that the ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) and ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF) pipelines may break in<br>July due to an increase in acute malnutrition admissions during the first quarter of 2024.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br>Furthermore, the outbreaks of AWD and measles in the BAY states have exacerbated the malnutrition crisis, leading to higher rates of SAM, increased morbidity, and mortality, decreased nutrient absorption, exacerbated nutritional deficiencies, and a strained healthcare<br>system. Children who were already moderately malnourished are quickly deteriorating to severe malnutrition due to the additional<br>health burdens, leading to a significant rise in the number of children suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM). Lack of access to<br>healthcare services, especially in hard-to-reach communities has led to complications such as severe dehydration and contributed to<br>poor management and control of AWD outbreaks, allowing the disease to spread more rapidly within communities.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To mitigate these effects, integrated health and nutrition interventions are essential, including disease prevention, nutritional support,<br>and strengthening of healthcare systems. The NRCS, through its grassroots presence of community-based skilled volunteer structures,<br>seeks to complement the efforts of the Government to strengthen Health and Nutrition Services through Community-Based Surveillance<br>(CBS), Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE), Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF), Protection, Gender, and Inclusion<br>(PGI) and WASH in Adamawa, Yobe and Borno States.</p>",

The situation has intensified, further exacerbating existing tensions in the affected areas.</p>\n<p>The recent conflict has resulted in a significant toll on the communities, with reports indicating a distressing number of casualties and an increase in displacement. The violence has left 13 individuals injured and, tragically, claimed the lives of 9 people. Additionally, the conflict has forced 400 individuals to become new internally displaced persons (IDPs).</p>\n<p>As of the latest updates, the security situation remains precarious, with ongoing tensions contributing to an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty. The conflict has disrupted normalcy in the affected villages, posing challenges to the residents' safety and well-being. Efforts to address and de-escalate the situation are underway by&nbsp; the government, but the region remains on edge.</p>\n<p>The local population, particularly in the villages of Majakata, Cikam, Shoron, and Mararraban Kantoma, is directly affected by the conflict. These communities now face the harsh reality of injuries, loss of lives, and displacement. The sudden upheaval has disrupted their daily lives, instilling a sense of vulnerability and insecurity.</p>\n<p>The consequences of the conflict are profound, with families mourning the loss of loved ones and individuals grappling with injuries. The newly displaced individuals, numbering 400, find themselves in precarious circumstances, with immediate needs for shelter, food, and medical attention. The social fabric of the affected communities has been strained as they navigate the aftermath of the conflict and strive to rebuild their lives.</p>",

            "description": "The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) has confirmed one case of Anthrax disease in a mixed livestock farm in Niger State. This is the first animal case to be reported in Nigeria since the beginning of the West Africa outbreak in Ghana in June 2023. On 13th July 2023, the sudden deaths of livestock in this farm with eight (8) mortality was reported. In addition, the animals who died were observed to have been bleeding from external orifices without blood clotting. The Nigerian Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) has said that anthrax disease may have spread to every part of the country. The NCDC said this hours after the Federal Government through the Ministry of Agriculture confirmed the first case of the disease in Niger state.\nThe case was in a multi-specie animal farm comprising of cattle, sheep and goats located at Gajiri, in Suleja Local Government Area, Niger State, where some of the animals had symptoms including oozing of blood from their body openings – anus, nose, eyes, and ears.\nAccording to the Spokesperson of FMARD, there were significant movements of animals in the area of the last religious feast. The areas are called down south, and it’s possible that in that region where animals are infected may have made their way into the country. Most especially for animals that were brought in across the borders. So, in this context, there may be other animals with it.\nThe country’s Ministry of Health also expressed worry that anthrax has spread across the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Stating that it is possible that the disease is currently across the country and likely other cases that are yet to be notified.\n\nThe signs of anthrax-infected animals include the oozing of blood from their body openings – (anus, nose, eyes, and ears), and high fever; it should be noted that, in many cases, the sign is not visible and leads to sudden death.\n\nFollowing the report, samples were collected on 14th July 2023 from multiple species in this livestock farm and transported to the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI), VOM, Plateau State for testing and the results were positive for anthrax.\n\nFurther investigation is also ongoing to trace the source of the infection and to identify the spread to other farms and humans. Though human exposure has been reported, there are no reports so far of human symptoms or mortality. The FMARD and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) are currently working closely with the Niger State Ministries of Health and Agriculture to identify, isolate and follow up all exposed persons.",

            "description": "The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) has confirmed reports of diphtheria cases in Lagos, Osun, Kano and Yobe States. In addition to clinically suspected cases, there have been laboratory-confirmed cases and the Nigerian Red Cross Society is working closely with the NCDC, State Ministries of Health and partners to enhance surveillance and response to the outbreak. Diphtheria is a severe bacterial disease caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium species, mainly by toxin-producing Corynebacterium diphtheriae and rarely by toxin-producing strains of C. ulcerans and C. pseudotuberculosis. It manifests as laryngitis, pharyngitis or tonsillitis and is associated with the presence of an adherent membrane covering the tonsils, pharynx and/or nose. Beyond the respiratory symptoms, approximately a quarter of cases may develop heart problems (myocarditis). The mainstay of Diphtheria treatment is antibiotics and Diphtheria antitoxin (DAT). As at the time of this report, Kano State has the highest number of 100 cases and 32 deaths, followed by Lagos State with five recorded confirmed cases and three deaths, Yobe has 17 confirmed cases and three deaths and Osun State with one confirmed case with no death recorded. According to the Director General of NCDC, Given the sub-optimal coverage for the third dose of diphtheria containing pentavalent vaccine (54% – 2021 Nigeria Immunization Coverage Survey) in the country, we expect more cases from more states. The most common type of diphtheria is classic respiratory diphtheria. The onset of signs and symptoms is usually from 2 – 5 days (could be as high as 10 days) after exposure. Initial symptoms may be mild and include fever, runny nose, sore throat, cough, and red eyes (conjunctivitis). In severe cases, the bacteria produce an exotoxin that causes a thick grey or white patch (pseudo-membrane) on the tonsils and/or at the back of the throat. This can block the airway making it hard to breathe or swallow and causing a barking cough. The neck may swell in part due to enlarged lymph nodes and may frequently confer a bull-neck appearance. To reduce the risk of diphtheria, the NCDC has published a Public Health Advisory which offers the key messages and health advice to healthcare workers and the general public. The NRCS Health team are coordinating with the Incident manager at NCDC for more updates, while the state teams are actively participating in the coordination meetings at the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC).",

        "summary": "<p>An outbreak of diphtheria has been ravaging Nigeria since December 2022, resulting in 12,041 suspected cases, 7,487 cases confirmed and 471 deaths (5.3 per cent case-fatality ratio (CFR)) as of 28 September 2023. In addition to illness and loss of life, the outbreak is having a toll on the already stretched public health facilities and health workers in Nigeria, as well as families that must care for the ill, resulting in disruption of livelihoods. A massive spike has been observed since July 2023, with over 1,000 weekly cases identified since. Kano state is the epicentre of the outbreak, and despite some recent decline in this state due to an uptake of the response and vaccination, the outbreak is now spread over 19 states and 111 local government areas (LGA), where active case finding, contact tracing, and vaccination is still underperforming. In some of these states, the CFR is above 20 per cent - an indication of the limited Community Based Surveillance (CBS) and response capacity in these areas.</p>\r\n<p>(6 per cent), Sokoto (2 per cent), and Enugu, Ogun, Osun, Kaduna, Lagos and Zamfara states, all with 1 per cent each. By June, Federal Capitol Territory (FCT), which includes Abuja, and Cross River were also reporting cases. Of the 7,487 confirmed cases, 73.6 per cent were children aged between 1-14 years old. More than half of all cases (57.4 per cent) were among females. Vaccination is ongoing, but still with a reduced coverage (23.9 per cent) amongst the confirmed cases, and mostly concentrated in Kano state. The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control vaccination plan is to reach full vaccination amongst confirmed and suspected cases, and eventually scale-up the routine immunization within areas most at risk. This outbreak has had a significant impact, including through increased hospitalization of those affected and severe economic stress. There have been reports of school closures in Bauchi state to slow the spread and this may continue in the coming weeks, particularly as schools resume in October.</p>\r\n<p>Nigeria Red Cross has been supporting the government-led response since March 2023, in six states, through an allocation of CHF 430,654 from the IFRC Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF). Since then, Nigeria Red Cross has performed the following activities:</p>\r\n<p>• <strong>760 volunteers trained</strong> in Public Health and Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) for Diphtheria, <strong>reaching 4,966,680 people</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>• <strong>922,334 people sensitized</strong> about the importance of, and mobilized for the governments’ <strong>vaccination program</strong>, via 120 trained vaccination teams.</p>\r\n<p>• <strong>1,915 suspected cases detected and referred to health facilities by Nigeria Red Cross Society volunteers</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Given the key role Nigeria Red Cross Society (NRCS) has been playing in this response, the Government of Nigeria has officially requested a scale up of the response. NRCS is hence requesting this Emergency Appeal, <strong>scaling up its activities to twelve states</strong> (previously six), following activities under the government plan. </p>",

            "description": "From 1st January to 24th July 2022, there have now been 357 suspected cases, 3 deaths and 133 confirmed cases (89 male, 44 female) from twenty-six (26) states – Lagos (17), Adamawa (11), Delta (11), Rivers (10), Bayelsa (10), Ondo (9), Edo (8), Nasarawa (7), Plateau (6), FCT (5), Anambra (5), Taraba (5), Imo (4), Cross River (3), Kwara (3), Borno (3), Oyo (3), Kano (2), Katsina (2), Gombe (2), Kogi (2), Niger (1), Ogun (1), Bauchi (1), Akwa Ibom (1) and Abia (1).\n\nIn Epi week 29 (18th to 24th July 2022), nineteen (19) new suspected cases reported from twelve (12) states – Ondo (4), Bayelsa (3), Taraba (2), Lagos (2), Rivers (1), Kogi (1), Kano (1), Imo (1), Delta (1), Anambra (1), Akwa Ibom (1) and Abia (1). Of nineteen (19) suspected cases, fifteen (15) new confirmed positive cases were recorded from 10 states – Ondo (3), Taraba (2), Lagos (2), Bayelsa (2), Rivers (1), Kogi (1), Imo (1), Delta (1), Anambra (1) and Abia (1).\n\nOn 26th May 2022, the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (NCDC) activated a national multisectoral Emergency Operations Centre for Monkeypox (MPX-EOC) at level 2 to strengthen and coordinate ongoing response activities in-country while contributing to the global response. This was based on the report of a preliminary risk assessment done by a group of Subject Matter Experts from the NCDC, relevant government Ministries Departments and Agencies and partner agencies.\n\nMonkeypox (MPX) is a rare viral zoonotic infectious disease (i.e., an infection transmitted from animals to humans) that is endemic in areas in and near tropical rainforests in Central and West Africa. It is caused by the Monkeypox virus which belongs to the same Orthopoxvirus genus and Poxviridae family of viruses as the Variola virus (Smallpox virus), the Vaccinia virus (used in smallpox vaccine for eradication programme), and the cowpox virus (used in earlier generations of smallpox vaccines) and some other viruses.  The exact reservoir of the MPX virus is still unknown although rodents are suspected to play a part in transmission. \n\nThe virus can spread both from animal-to-human (which is the first (spill-over) event preceding the detection of cases in humans), and from human-to-human. Animal-to-human transmission may occur by direct contact with the blood, body fluids, the skin or mucosal lesions of infected animals (e.g., monkeys, squirrels, and rodents). This can happen through a bite, scratch, handling of, or eating inadequately cooked or other products of infected bushmeat. Human-to-human (person-to-person) transmission occurs when a person comes into contact with the virus from an infected human, or materials contaminated with the virus such as clothing, beddings. As a consequence, household members or healthcare workers are at greater risk of infection. The virus enters the body through broken skin (even if not visible), the respiratory tract, or the mucous membranes of the eyes, nose, or mouth. Human-to-human transmission may also occur through aerosols/droplets following prolonged face-to-face or close contact. Symptoms of monkeypox include sudden fever, headache, body pain, weakness, sore throat, enlargement of glands (lymph nodes) in the neck and under the jaw, followed by the appearance of a rash (often solid or fluid-filled at the onset) on the face, palms, soles of the feet, genitals and other parts of the body.\n\nAlthough Nigeria’s risk of exposure to the Monkeypox virus is high based on the recent risk assessment conducted at NCDC, the current situation in-country and globally has shown no significant threat to life or the community that can result in severe disease or high case fatality rate. The NRCS is complementing the effort of the Government to continuously emphasize that members of the public should remain aware of the risk of Monkeypox and adhere to public health safety measures - specifically, report to the nearest health facility if they notice the known signs and symptoms of the disease; while monitoring the evolving situation of the epidemic.",

Most infected people develop no symptoms or only mild diarrhea. However, approximately one in 10 infected people develop severe cholera, which causes symptoms including profuse, watery diarrhea, vomiting, rapid heart rate, low blood pressure, muscle cramps, restlessness, or irritability. Symptoms typically appear 2-3 days after exposure but can develop up to 5 days after exposure. Individuals with severe cholera can develop acute renal failure, severe electrolyte imbalances, and coma. If left untreated, these can lead to shock and rapid death.\nCholera is a waterborne disease and the risk of transmission is higher where there are poor sanitation and disruption of clean water supply. The wrong disposal of refuse and practices, such as open defecation, endanger the safety of water used for drinking and for personal use.\nThe long-term solution for cholera control lies in access to safe drinking water, maintenance of proper sanitation and hygiene. The Nigerian Red Cross Society has continued to raise awareness on prevention, early detection and management of the disease. RC volunteers are conducting light awareness due to lack of resources. \nThe Government of Nugeria has called on all local and international partners to supoort in intensifying the response to save lives and curb the spread of this epidemic.",

        "summary": "Food security is a basic human need, and fighting hunger is one of the greatest challenges of this century not least in Nigeria. According to an analysis done in October 2020, about 9.8 million people were estimated to be in need of external food assistance from October to December 2020 in the country,. This is a significant increase from the estimated 4 million people during the same months in 2019. This number is projected to dramatically increase further to 12.8 million during the lean season from June to August 2021. The North East of the country has a high level of food insecurity affected by long running armed conflict and violence. Nigeria’s North West region – particularly states of Zamfara, Sokoto, and Katsina – has in recent years seen a deterioration in the security situation, marked by an increase in banditry and violence. The crisis has accelerated during the past years because of the intensification of attacks and has resulted in widespread displacement across the region. Reportedly, nearly 280,000 people are displaced in the three states as of January 2021. Disrupted livelihoods and reduced market access have lessened households’ capacity to meet their essential needs. It is reported1 that in North West Nigeria, 2.53 million people are projected to face acute food insecurity (Phase 3 and above) in June – August 2021 lean period. An estimated five percent of the total food insecure population (138,476 individuals) are internally displaced persons (IDPs), of which 26,000 are in the emergency acute food insecurity phase (CH phase 4). Zamfara North, Katsina Central and Katsina South are projected to be in Crisis phase between June and August 2021. The higher prevalence of acute food insecurity mainly reflects the adverse effects of measures to contain the COVID‑19 pandemic on the supply chain, the escalation of armed and community conflicts, some localized cereal production shortfalls, the unfavourable macro‑economic conditions, and high food prices.",

Intermittent and recurrent outbreaks were common between 1995 to 2001 in Nigeria. Though cholera outbreaks became less common with improved sanitation in the early 2000s, the case fatality rate has steadily increased with each additional outbreak.\nThe Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) is leading the national response to an outbreak of cholera across states in Nigeria. This has been exacerbated by poor access to clean water, open defecation, poor sanitation, and hygiene.\nFollowing an increase in the number of cholera cases, the National Cholera Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) was activated on the 22nd of June 2021, which Nigerian Red Cross Society is an active member.\nA reactive oral cholera vaccine (OCV) campaign led by NPHCDA was conducted in Bauchi LGA, Bauchi State from 24th to 28th July 2021, But more is required to address the underlying issues leading to the increasing cases across the states.",

The wrong disposal of refuse and practices such as open defecation endanger the safety of water used for drinking and personal use. These lead to the spread of water-borne diseases such as cholera. Without proper water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH), Nigeria remains at risk of cholera cases and deaths.\nCholera is preventable and treatable; however, it can be deadly when people who are infected do not access care immediately.\nAs a result of the rising security concerns in the country, response efforts are experiencing challenges in reaching a handful of communities with risk communication strategies, outbreak response measures, and vaccination campaigns. \nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, health system resources have been stressed in responding to the influx of patients with COVID-19. With the ongoing cholera outbreak, hospitals and health centers have experienced similar challenges keeping up with the number of patients requiring hospitalization. \nCommunity level rapid response activities is needed to quickly detect, diagnose, and respond to cases in states experiencing higher levels of community spread of cholera throughout Nigeria. There is need for urgent intervention on Risk communication, health and hygiene promotion as well as management of ORP centres in communities for stabilization of casualties and supportive referrals to treatment centres.  With the grassroot presence of the community based volunteers, NRCS is better placed to address the issues leading to the escalated spread of cholera and promote healthy behaviours that will reduce the spread of this scourge.",

Volunteers have also conducted live radio call in shows to educate the masses on the outbreak and address misconceptions on the disease which started off as a strange illness.\nIn Delta State where the COVID-19 Emergency Operation is ongoing, the trained volunteers have also integrated Yellow Fever messages during the COVID- 19 awareness sessions and during community meetings, to further enlighten the public about the disease.\nThe NRCS however seeks to scale up community intervention across the affected communities and engage is mass awareness to contribute to the effort of the Government in containing the spread of the disease.",
