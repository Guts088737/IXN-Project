        "summary": "<p>The evolving situation in Afghanistan is increasingly creating new potential drivers and triggers for cross-border displacement. The 2021 Afghanistan Humanitarian Needs Overview identified 18.4 million people in need of humanitarian assistance with 6.3 million being in extreme or catastrophic severity of needs; this figure is now likely to have increased due to the recent events in country. The situation remains uncertain in Afghanistan and may evolve rapidly.</p>\r\n<p>Afghanistan faces an alarming humanitarian emergency and a worsening economic crisis, both likely to be further compounded by the approaching winter season. Almost half the population faces colossal humanitarian needs wrought by a combination of crises: displacement, devastation of COVID-19 pandemic, drought, acute food shortages, a fractured health system, poor access to services, and restrictive social norms. More than 558,000 Afghans have been internally displaced by the conflict since January 2021, 80 per cent of these newly internally displaced are women and children.</p>\r\n<p>According to the drought declaration by the Afghanistan government of 22 June 2021, the country’s wheat crop will be reduced by nearly two million tons, and more than three million livestock are in danger of perishing due to a lack of fodder and water. IPC new projections for the period June – November 2021 estimates that, 2,742,741 Afghans are likely to be classified in Phase 4 (catastrophic) in terms of Food Insecurity and 6,719,607 in Phase 3 (emergency). The compounding impacts of drought and conflict which escalated in July and the first half of August have exacerbated the hard living conditions in a country that is also grappling with COVID-19 and poverty. Access to banking services has been severely constrained, with cashflow crippled. Collapse of Afghanistan’s economy would result in catastrophic consequences for vulnerable Afghans, including potentially fueling cross-border movements for economic reasons.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, based on analysis of the ongoing social, economic, political and security situation in Afghanistan, it is assessed that a further political and humanitarian deterioration in the country is likely to result in new population movements to neighbouring countries. A potential worst-case scenario – utilized by the UNHCR and inter-agency partners - envisages the arrival of an additional 515,000 Afghan refugees into neighbouring countries before the end of 2021.</p>\r\n<p>Any major population movement will require an immediate and sustained humanitarian intervention in neighbouring countries. This will include critical life-saving humanitarian assistance at border points and in designated sites in coordination with respective authorities.</p>\r\n<p>There are up to six million Afghans living outside of Afghanistan – in Europe, Asia Pacific and the Middle East - following several decades of instability in the country. New arrivals in 2021 will join more than 2.2 million registered refugees who have fled previous waves of insecurity, instability and violence to neighbouring countries. There are a further 3 million Afghans with varying status including many irregular migrants, who have been hosted in the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan over the past four decades. It will be important to maintain humanitarian assistance and protection for both new arrivals, and those previously displaced, as well as host communities.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond the scope of this Emergency Appeal, there may also be onward movements and humanitarian needs in secondary countries, with Afghans taking routes to Turkey, Greece and the Western Balkans region. It will be critical to both monitor these trends and developments, as well as to be prepared and ready to provide increased principled humanitarian assistance and protection along existing migratory routes to those on the move– irrespective of their status – and to host communities in secondary countries.</p>\r\n<br />\r\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"https://ryales.github.io/go-timeline/\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\"> </iframe></div>",
