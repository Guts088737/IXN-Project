            "description": "The Gambia, like any other country around the globe, continues to face the impacts of climate change. This has led to erratic patterns of rainfall for the past years. 2022 is no exception to this as the rains started earlier than normal. The rains have been predicted to be above normal accompanied by winds. \nThe rains started on 26th May 2022 with a long dry spell afterwards. Some spontaneous rains were also realized during the months of June and July. From 30th to 31st July 2022, heavy rains have been experienced throughout the country. This has led to mass flooding across the country. Some houses have been severely affected that the occupants have to be evacuated to public buildings such as health facilities, mosques and schools for safety. Similarly rains and flooding were realized on 3rd to 5th August 2022 in Upper River Region and Many parts of the country, and this is expected to continue as the rainy season is still left with 2 months. \nThe regions that are currently severely affected are Banjul, Kanifing Municipality, West Coast, and North Bank. In North Bank Region, 4 kids have been reported dead and 1 is in critical condition and under treatment as a result of the thunderstorm that accompanied the rains on 30th July 2022. One (1) other person is also reported dead in the West Coast Region. Lower River Region is reported with few households affected.\nThe Vice President of The Gambia, during his visit to communities affected by the heavy rainfall, disclosed that the Government is working on plans to come up with a resettling scheme for people residing on waterway areas to solve the flooding which people have been grappling with for years around the Greater Banjul Areas. At the time of writing this update, some roads are still not accessible due to the overflow of rain water. \nAccording to the meteorological department, slight to moderate rain and thunderstorms were expected to prevail over the country during the night of Saturday 30th July. Torrential, moderate to heavy rain and thunderstorms was expected over the country from the early hours of Sunday 31st July, until late in the afternoon which might result to flash flooding over areas prone to flooding. For the 1st August, the wet conditions were expected to prevail over most places in the early hours of the morning particularly the western sector, becoming warm with sunny intervals, with low chances of thunderstorms and rain thereafter. On 2nd August, rains and thunderstorms were expected to prevail over places especially the inland sector from the early parts of the forecast and part of the day.\nMost of these predictions were realized which led to the current flooding situation. According to the first situational report shared by the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA), a total of 17,201 people (1961 households) have been affected as of the 30th – 31st July rains. This is segregated per region as follows: \n•\tWest Coast Region (WCR): 1500HH (13,500 people)\n•\tNorth Bank Region (NBR): 200 HH (1600 people)\n•\tKanifing Municipality (KM): 250HH (2000 people)\n•\tLower River Region (LRR): 11 HH (101 people)\nAs of 5th August 2022, the data verified by GRCS volunteers was Nine hundred and sixty-three (963) households of 11, 321 people (Male: 5,457 and Female: 5,864). The main priorities identified by the GRCS during the verification were emergency shelter, food, WASH, health, PSS and PGI for the affected households as seen below:\n•\t12.1% of affected households, i.e. 117 houses are completely destroyed\n•\t22% of affected households, i.e. 211 houses are partially destroyed\n•\t13.4% of affected households, i.e. 129 houses no longer have a roof\n•\t52.5% households, i.e. 506 houses were flooded, but infrastructures not destroyed, however lost food stuff, beddings etc.\n\nAs the verification and registration continuous through the rapid assessment more data on the affected households and people are expected to further increase. Many people have been displaced at the time of preparing this update due to flooding and destruction of buildings. \n\nMost of these affected people in Banjul (BJL), Kainifng Municipality (KM), West Coast Region (WCR), North Bank Region (NBR), Lower River Region (LRR) and Upper River Region (URR) are housed with relatives, host families, schools, mosques, health facilities, and uncompleted buildings. The majority of the damaged houses are built by owners, who are not professional builders, making houses susceptible to natural disasters. Adding to that, the building materials are not up to standard. Some of the affected households are house owners while some are tenants. The immediate shelter needs identified by the assessment are:\n•\tBuilding / roofing materials (trusses, rafters, iron sheets and nails);\n•\tBuilding super structure for roofing (wood to provide basement for the rafters).\n•\tHousehold materials (buckets, jerry cans, blankets, mosquito nets and beddings); \n\nA detailed needs assessment has not been undertaken yet though the NDMA is in consultation with partners to commission one. This update has been drafted based on preliminary information GRCS has received from the deployed teams and from its Branch staff conducting some verifications in the communities. A detailed/continuous assessment is planned and budgeted for under this operation and shall be undertaken before the operations starts in earnest. Based on the verification done so far by the volunteers, there have been loss of loss of lives, houses, loss of seed stores, loss of toilet facilities, contaminated water sources, loss of livestock’s, and loss of farmlands. GRCS will provide more comprehensive data once detailed assessments are conducted in the coming weeks. The GRCS rapid assessment teams identified the following specific vulnerabilities: the elderly, people living with disabilities, injured people, displaced persons, pregnant and lactating women, widows, , children, and families that lost loved ones as a result of the flood situation. Trauma was common among these vulnerable groups. \nIn Banjul, some households have temporally relocated to Saint Joseph's and Saint Augustines’s Senior Secondary School where the GRCS have provided them with mattresses, mats, blankets, mosquito nets, hygiene kits, water purification tablets, and detergents for temporal use. The office of the Mayor and other people are currently providing support on their feeding.\n\nThe flood has been reported on social media (Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter) by several media outlets. The Gambia Red Cross Society has also updated its Social Media Platforms with information about the flood situation and our response. \nBoth ICRC and IFRC are inform about the situation and fully monitoring the developments, and supporting in the resource mobilization.",

            "description": "On 26th July 2022, the Epidemiology and Disease Control unit of The Gambia received a report through the Director of Health Services from a Nephrologist indicating a sudden increase in the number of cases of acute kidney injury (AKI) among children aged 5 months to 7 years who were being treated at Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital (ETSTH). AKI refers to an abrupt decrease in kidney function that happens within a few hours or a few days. AKI causes a build-up of waste products in the blood and makes it hard for the kidneys to keep the right balance of fluid in the body. \nSome of the signs and symptoms of AKI include oliguria or anuria, oedema, confusion, nausea, diarrhoea, shortness of breath, chest pain, coma among others. A case definition was developed, and active case search revealed additional cases. The index case was traced to 4th July 2022. As of 30th September 2022, about 78 cases of AKI had been reported including 66 deaths (CFR 85%.) About 72% of the cases were under the age of two years. Cases were reported from all the 7 regions of the country, with 87% of cases reported from three health regions (Western Region 1 and 2 and Upper River Region). Clinical features among cases include fever (81% of cases), vomiting (61%), diarrhoea (51%) and cough (10%). The average duration of illness is nine days (range 5-18 days). This is the first known outbreak of acute kidney injury (AKI) in the country. Stool sample-test results from 62 children with acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) showed 38 (61%) tested positive for E. coli, including two samples positive for Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (O157:H7). \nIn addition, nine samples of medicines taken by children with AKI were sent for toxicological tests, and the medications were found to contain diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol. \nFor the past 2 weeks, 2 confirmed cases were reported, and they both died. The 2 deaths occurred at EFSTH on 27th September 2022 and 28th September 2022. The latter was a female, 31 months old, admitted at EFSTH on 27th September 2022 and presented with vomiting for 12 days; oliguria for 6 days; anorexia for 5 days; anuria for 5 days and swelling of feet for 4 days. The patient was taken to a health centre where she was diagnosed with malaria. 3 syrups were prescribed, but the mother could not remember the names, though she was told that one of the syrups was paracetamol. The vomiting stopped on day 2 of the illness. 6 days after using the syrup, the mother noticed reduced urination; during the night the child didn’t urinate but passed a little in the morning. The next day, vomiting continued and she returned to the health centre where tests were conducted and she was sent home and given ibuprofen, cotrimoxazole and B-complex, the child also had a swollen foot. The patient’s mother took her to EFSTH on self-referral and she died the next day.\nOf all the cases reported, 60% are male while 40% are female. The minimum (mean) age is 20 months (+ SD), maximum (median) age is 17 (IQR) months, with a range of 2-84 months. The highest number of cases was among children 1-2 years. At the time of writing this report, 78 cases have been recorded. \nEarlier, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) quarantined all suspected syrups and seized all batches of syrups with DEG and EG from the importers, wholesalers and retailers including government-owned hospitals. Active case searches at the health facilities are on-going to identify missed cases and also to update line-list. 2 cases were reported in the last 14 days. They both died at the EFSTH referral hospital. Hospital-based case control study was completed and awaiting presentation. Study controls were matched according to age, sex, hospitalization dates and presentation of fever in patients. Study findings will be documented for reference. Anthropologists are in the field to conduct in-depth interviews with caregivers and investigate narratives around the AKI cases and nearby communities.

The vomiting stopped on day 2 of the illness. 6 days after using the syrup, the mother noticed reduced urination; during the night the child didn’t urinate but passed a little in the morning. The next day, vomiting continued and she returned to the health centre where tests were conducted and she was sent home and given ibuprofen, cotrimoxazole and B-complex, the child also had a swollen foot. The patient’s mother took her to EFSTH on self-referral and she died the next day.\nOf all the cases reported, 60% are male while 40% are female. The minimum (mean) age is 20 months (+ SD), maximum (median) age is 17 (IQR) months, with a range of 2-84 months. The highest number of cases was among children 1-2 years. At the time of writing this report, 78 cases have been recorded. \nEarlier, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) quarantined all suspected syrups and seized all batches of syrups with DEG and EG from the importers, wholesalers and retailers including government-owned hospitals. Active case searches at the health facilities are on-going to identify missed cases and also to update line-list. 2 cases were reported in the last 14 days. They both died at the EFSTH referral hospital. Hospital-based case control study was completed and awaiting presentation. Study controls were matched according to age, sex, hospitalization dates and presentation of fever in patients. Study findings will be documented for reference. Anthropologists are in the field to conduct in-depth interviews with caregivers and investigate narratives around the AKI cases and nearby communities.

            "description": "In the afternoon of 13th March 2022 fighting broke out between the Senegalese Soldiers in the Cassamance Region and Rebel Groups who are believed to be the MFDC in the Cassamance Bush area. Residents in the borderline villages of The Gambia especially Ballen Village have started sending out their women and children to other villages for safety. Information reaching the Gambia Red Cross Society (GRCS) from the field indicates that almost 300 villagers have already moved out of their villages. This information was received around 16:00hrs.\n\nThis village and others were affected during the 24th January 2022 clashes between the ECOMIG Senegalese Contingent in The Gambia and the same MFDC Rebel Group. The Gambia Red Cross Society has activated its Emergency Response Team who are on full alert for any humanitarian response. The team has convened an immediate emergency meeting at the GRCS head office to discuss on how to respond to the humanitarian needs of the affected communities while considering their safety and security as well.\n\nIt is important to note that the fighting is happening in the Cassamance area but this area is bordered with The Gambia (Foni) and is very likely to have impacts in The Gambia as families in the villages on the Gambian side have already started moving inland for safety.\nThe Gambian military personnel are also reported to be around the border communities to protect the Gambian territory. \n\nIn the evening of the 13th March 2022, it is reported that sounds of heavy weapons were heard and bullets were also seen in some of the Gambian villages along the Border with cassamance. This caused fear and panic within the sounding villages of Ballen, Kapa, Luluchurr, Boipal, Kalunor, Gikessdendon, Karrol, and Funtang all in Foni Kansala District, West Coast. \nAccording to the information gathered by GRCS, from both the security forces and the community members, the violence started around 13:00hrs on 13 March 2022 which left fears and panic within the above mentioned communities resulting to displacement of people especially women and children. Most of these people are currently hosted in villages of Arangaleh, Bajagharr, Kampant, Bwiam, Sibanor, and Bujingha in the West Coast Region. \nHowever, based on the first assessment conducted with only few villages covered, an estimated number of 317 people are said to be displaced. \n\nHowever, these figures were collected during the initial rapid assessment and it was noted that some Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) were not recorded. Therefore, more IDPs are expected be recorded in the above mention villages. The figures also exclude other host communities of Bwiam, Sibanor, Kanfenda, Kampong, Dobong, Burock and Batabutu due to the fact that the situation was tensed and unsafe for the GRCS team to proceed to these communities. The assessment will continue on 14th March 2022 if the situation permits.  \nDue to the tension in the area, it was reported that the Gambia Military personnel advised the host communities to temporally close their businesses at 12:00am, especially the shops, for security reasons. There is also heavy presence of the Gambia Armed Forces patrolling the area. This incident has already been seen circulating on different social media platforms (Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter) by several media outlets and personal accounts of individuals. \nIt also remained critical that Red Cross personnel on the operations strictly adhered to the humanitarian principles, in particular neutrality and impartiality, and the Safer Access Framework to mitigate security-related risks. \n\nTo respond to the humanitarian needs of the affected people, GRCS has deployed some of its personnel with some non-food items (NFIs) to the area. These include: mats, blankets, buckets, and Mosquito nets. The GRCS ERT had a briefing meeting with the Gambia Police Force for security updates. Meetings with other partners and local authorities in the areas are underway to give GRCS a clear view of the incident. \n\nThe National Society will continue to monitor the overall environment in the district to identify changes related to security issues. This will help to appropriately respond to the situation to mitigate risks to volunteers and staff. \n\nBased on need and relevance, the Gambia Red Cross is recommending for a month extension of the current DREF operation in this area with additional funds in order to meet the additional needs of the affected population.\n\nThe situation from Tuesday 15th to Thursday 17th March 2022 has been more complex as more and more sound of Heavy Weapons is being heard and is becoming closer to the borders of The Gambia. This time even light weapons like AK47 are heard and bullets were also seen in some of the Gambian villages along the Border notably in Kanilai, Ballen, Kappa and some other communities on the Trans-Gambia highway (Kampanti, and Kampong Villages). \n\nThis has also caused some fear and panic in some border villages located in Cassamance resulting in high number people (mostly women and children) moving from Cassamance into The Gambia. They came with no or little belongings and some also sustained injuries.  \n\nAdditionally, due to the heavy firing in the early hours of 17th March 2022, more people flee their homes from the Gambian villages along the border, even men who initially were not willing to vacate their homes are now joining their families in communities along the highways (off the borders). \n\nReports from community members indicate that cross firing in Cassamance has affected some communities on the Trans-Gambia highway including Bwiam. Hence a warning shoot was release from the ECOMIG soldiers’ base in Bwiam which increased panic among the population. Although Arangaleh, Bajagharr, Kampanti, Bwiam, Kanilai, Sibanor, Batabutu, Benlo, Krunulai, Kanfenda, Mayork, Bondali, Bambara, and Bujingha are still the host communities, these communities are becoming unsafe for the people. GRCS also received information of some IDPs in Jarra Soma, Kiang Missira and Wurokang in the Lower River Region (LRR).\n\nAfter having a quick survey during the early hours of 17 March 2022, the GRCS team realised that the Soldiers at the ECOMIG military Check Point in Bwiam were all armed and were in their military vehicles. Some were positioned in strategy places which seemed to be a sign of readiness for defence or to launch attack from The Gambia soil if there is any treat. The same scenario is seen in Kanfenda and Kanilai. Schools and workplaces around these areas are closing causing interruption of normal businesses. The presence of the ECOMIG Helicopter within the area was still visibly noticed, which also increase the fear and panic. \n\nAs of 19 March 2022, more than 9800 are being affected. This includes the internally displaced, those coming from Cassamance, and the host communities. Currently over 48 communities/villages are affected either as community of origin or host community.\n\nThese figures were collected on a Joint Assessment between GRCS, the Government of The Gambia, and other relevant partners. As of 19 March 2022, more people are coming into the villages along the highway as the fighting intensifies. Bush fires have also resulted from the firing along both the Gambian and Cassamance bushes. The assessment and verification will continue if the environment is safe for it.  However, GRCS will use the interrupted joint rapid assessment as a baseline to conduct verification and determine the extent of the impact and the immediate needs of the affected families.\n\nBoth ICRC and IFRC are being informed about the situation and are fully monitoring the developments. As the situation keeps unfolding, GRCS is continuously monitoring and shall keep the ICRC and IFRC updated.",

            "description": "Gambia Red Cross (GRCS) received a message on a stormy weather situation within Central River Region (CRR) and Upper River Region (URR) on 02 July 2021, at around 17:30hrs. By 1900hrs, the Secretary General (SG) called for an emergency meeting, together with the National Society (NS) head office team. The emergency meeting was held at the headquarters to deploy a team of staff and volunteers to forefront and provide humanitarian services on immediate needs of the affected families. A work plan was drafted instantly, this included dividing of tasks, mitigating risks, and gather resources to be used to minimize loss and damages. The following steps were taken during the meeting:\n•\tEvacuation procedures, escape routes/emergency shelter.\n•\tReporting to and alerting authorities.\n•\tAlerting staff and volunteers of an emergency situation.\n•\tAccounting for people after implementing an EAP.\n•\tNotifying and recording as we go\n•\tIdentifying a media contact person.\n Emergency Response Plan Include\n•\tA contact list;\n•\tThe safety duties and responsibilities of each member in the society for this specific emergency;\n•\tProcedural actions required to maintain safety;\n•\tProcedural actions required to mitigate the danger;\n\nInformation related to the storm were collected by Red Cross volunteers together with the National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) and the affected families. The situation is closely being monitored by GRCS staffs and volunteers across the country. As of 5 of July, GRCS registered additional 2 regions being affected; Lower River Region (LRR) and North Bank Region (NBR). The details gave a total of 97 communities with 148 households, and 1024 people affected. 24 people were reported to be displaced, 4 have sustained injuries and 0 zero deaths.\n\nThe situation is being worsened by another storm that hit across the country on 07 June 2021, causing widespread damage, displacements and loss of lives. By the 8 of July 2021, GRCS has gathered more information on the level of damage in the regions of; Kanifing Municipality (KM), West Coast Region (WCR), Lower River Region (LRR), North Bank Region (NBR), Central River Region (CRR) and Upper River Region (URR). So far, a total of 220 households have been reported with 3114 people affected. 1531 people are reported to be displaced, about 30 have sustained injuries and 7 deaths confirmed. \n\nIn addition to houses being affected, some public facilities in the Lower River Region have also been affected by the windstorm. This includes the following:\n•\t3 schools: 2 completely destroyed and 1 partially destroyed\n•\t1 Health center completely destroyed\n•\t2 seed-stores partially destroyed\n\nGRCS has sent monitoring teams with vehicles to all the affected regions and are working with the regional teams in obtaining more data on the level of damage and also to provide some immediate support in the form of non-food items. The materials include buckets, blankets, mats, jerry cans, bed sheets, soap, hand sanitizers, detergents, and personal protective equipment. In all the regions, these teams have met with the regional authorities on the purpose of their mission and also to collaborate with them on the response. \n\nOn 08 July, GRCS issued a press release on the situation and the response activities done so far, and also on the launch of a Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (GREF). On 08 July 2021, GRCS was invited at the NDMA head office for a press briefing where the Secretary General attended on behalf of the National Society. Media interviews are also being conducted across the country with GRCS personnel on the situation and what GRCS is doing in response. \n\nGRCS Senior Management and other relevant staff are also in the field on 09 June with the media to monitor the situation and inform its response plan for any necessary adjustments. \nAs of 13 July 2021, the assessment data received from the volunteers in the regions indicates a total of 20,253 people affected in 1266 households. This cuts across all the regions in the country. That is; \n•\tWCR: 5789 people affected in 354 households\n•\tURR: 2767 people affected in 171 Households\n•\tNBR: 9708 people affected in 601 households\n•\tLRR: 1396 people affected in 106 households\n•\tCRR: 562 people affected in 35 households\n•\tBanjul: 22 people affected in 2 households\n\nThe Kanifing Municipality is also affected but the data is yet to be received due to insufficient number of tablets.

            "description": "On Monday 15th March, 2021, there were clashes among local communities in one of the fishing villages (Sanyang) in The Gambia. A Senegalese national during a robbery attempt killed a Gambian that eventually made the locals of Sanyang to attack the Senegalese population living in the village. Several people were injured causing displacements among the people. The Gambia Red Cross Society responded during the clashes with First Aid personnel and two ambulances operated by our GPlus Emergency Response Services. Twenty-three (23) injured people recorded. \n\n\nAs of 17th March 2021, the Senegalese are displaced and being hosted in a very small nursery school in the community of Batokunku. The number registered at the hosting centre has drastically increased and more family members are joining, especially women and children which is overstretching the hosting capacity of the community.
