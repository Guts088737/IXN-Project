            "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On September 25, the Department of Hydrology and Metrology (DHM, GoN) issued a weather advisory for a new spell of monsoon, influenced by the moisture-laden winds from the Bay of Bengal and the local weather system, to remain active between 26 and 29 September with the potential to cause heavy rainfall in most of the provinces, triggering flash floods, landslides and overflow of rivers. This forecast turns into reality with heavy rainfall noticed in Bagmati and Gandaki provinces and moderately heavy rain in other provinces. In the last 24 hours, seven locations in Koshi province received above 120 to 140 mm rainfall, above 30 locations in Bagmati received above 140mm rainfall, and around 6 locations in Gandaki province received high to very high rainfall, while the rainfall in other provinces remains between moderate and high with minimal impact on lives and properties.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;The impact of this short but intensified rainfall across the country is evident from the real-time data: Over 101 of 272 real-time metrological stations observed the river crossing the danger level in the last 24 hours. The rainfall is expected to dissipate in the coming hours, with the possibility of scattered light to heavy rainfall throughout the country.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;In the early morning of 28 Sep. 24, multiple sources reported that nearly all streams and rivers in the Kathmandu Valley had overflowed, surpassing the danger levels and flooding nearby settlements along the riverbanks. Although there is no confirmed data on the extent of the damage yet, initial estimates suggest that over ten thousand people may be seeking refuge in open areas. It is expected that the floodwaters will take several hours to decrease.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;Reports of major and minor highways being washed away or severely eroded due to landslides and river erosion have emerged. The main highway &ndash; Kathmandu to Naryangadh &ndash; connecting Kathmandu to the rest of Nepal is currently inaccessible, with frequent mudslides at several locations, rendering it impassable for traffic and pedestrians. Similarly, massive blockages have been reported on other highways across the western and eastern Terai and in hilly areas. Kalikandaki corridor, a lifeline for at least three Syangja, Banglung and Parbat districts, is reportedly blocked due to several small to large landslides. Similarly, the Araniko highway is currently not passable due to numerous landslides along the road and a bridge collapse, a critical logistical corridor for Nepal to get supplies from China.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp; </span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;The water levels in the tributaries of the Koshi basin have increased, and the water level has reached both warning and danger levels. The flow of the Saptakoshi River was measured at 449,680 cusecs at 9 AM on Saturday. This is above the danger level. All 56 gates have been opened. We are actively trying to gather more information from the field. So far, DHM has already sent out 2 SMS alerts in the area since yesterday evening. Fortunately, the water has not yet entered the settlement areas (UN Situation Report, dated 28 Sept).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;The situation is expected to continue for several days, disrupting the supply of goods across the country as the festive season begins. This is likely to hike the price for essential commodities and may cause the stock to be out of stock if the roads remain impassable for several days.

        "summary": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">On September 25, the Department of Hydrology and Metrology (DHM, GoN) issued a weather advisory for a new spell of monsoon, influenced by the moisture-laden winds from the Bay of Bengal and the local weather system, to remain active between 26 and 29 September with the potential to cause heavy rainfall in most of the provinces, triggering flash floods, landslides and overflow of rivers. This forecast turns into reality with heavy rainfall noticed in Bagmati and Gandaki provinces and moderately heavy rain in other provinces. In the last 24 hours, seven locations in Koshi province received above 120 to 140 mm rainfall, above 30 locations in Bagmati received above 140mm rainfall, and around 6 locations in Gandaki province received high to very high rainfall, while the rainfall in other provinces remains between moderate and high with minimal impact on lives and properties.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> The impact of this short but intensified rainfall across the country is evident from the real-time data: Over 101 of 272 real-time metrological stations observed the river crossing the danger level in the last 24 hours. The rainfall is expected to dissipate in the coming hours, with the possibility of scattered light to heavy rainfall throughout the country.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> In the early morning of 28 Sep. 24, multiple sources reported that nearly all streams and rivers in the Kathmandu Valley had overflowed, surpassing the danger levels and flooding nearby settlements along the riverbanks. Although there is no confirmed data on the extent of the damage yet, initial estimates suggest that over ten thousand people may be seeking refuge in open areas. It is expected that the floodwaters will take several hours to decrease.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> Reports of major and minor highways being washed away or severely eroded due to landslides and river erosion have emerged. The main highway – Kathmandu to Naryangadh – connecting Kathmandu to the rest of Nepal is currently inaccessible, with frequent mudslides at several locations, rendering it impassable for traffic and pedestrians. Similarly, massive blockages have been reported on other highways across the western and eastern Terai and in hilly areas. Kalikandaki corridor, a lifeline for at least three Syangja, Banglung and Parbat districts, is reportedly blocked due to several small to large landslides. Similarly, the Araniko highway is currently not passable due to numerous landslides along the road and a bridge collapse, a critical logistical corridor for Nepal to get supplies from China.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">  </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> The water levels in the tributaries of the Koshi basin have increased, and the water level has reached both warning and danger levels. The flow of the Saptakoshi River was measured at 449,680 cusecs at 9 AM on Saturday. This is above the danger level. All 56 gates have been opened. We are actively trying to gather more information from the field. So far, DHM has already sent out 2 SMS alerts in the area since yesterday evening. Fortunately, the water has not yet entered the settlement areas (UN Situation Report, dated 28 Sept).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> The situation is expected to continue for several days, disrupting the supply of goods across the country as the festive season begins. This is likely to hike the price for essential commodities and may cause the stock to be out of stock if the roads remain impassable for several days. Debris cleaning remains challenging owing to the increasing number of sites requiring immediate attention and the severe lack of heavy equipment.<span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">  </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> For the second time after 25 years, both gates of Kulekhani Dam were opened as the water level reached a hazardous level due to continuous rainfall in the catchment area. This caused havoc in low-lying areas of Makawanpur, Kathmandu, Sarlahi, and Mahottari. Extensive details of the damages to lives and properties are out of reach at this stage.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">So far, there have been reports of around 22 districts affected by floods and landslides. </p>",

        "summary": "Flood is the most severe of the hazards observed in Nepal in terms of physical and socioeconomic losses and destruction. Koshi, Karnali, and Narayani are the major river systems in Nepal, and floods from these large perennial river systems generally impact several districts in the Southern Terai plains. Moreover, rivers such as West Rapti, and Babai Rivers, which originate in the Mahabharat range, do more damage in the Terai floodplains because they frequently generate flash floods during the monsoon. Moreover, the Terai's vulnerable topography, combined with its dependency on agriculture, exacerbates the severity of flood hazards compared to other regions.\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>In 2017, the prolonged rainfall across Nepal from 11-14 August 2017 brought flooding across 31 districts of Nepal. The southern Terai region was particularly affected with an estimated 450,000 people affected by flooding, 43 people were killed. According to the Government of Nepal, National Planning Commission Post Disaster Need Assessment Report (PDNA) 2017, it has been estimated that 41,626 houses were destroyed, and 150,510 houses were damaged by the flooding. Over 126,282 ha of paddy were damaged during the flooding, with higher-value crops such as vegetables and aquaculture also suffering significantly. Moreover, the flooding affected over 812,000 poultry, 9,400 cattle, and 74,000 sheds.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>The targeted flood-prone areas are the Terai districts along the flood plains of Karnali, Babai and West Rapti rivers, namely Banke, Bardiya and Kailali. frequently affected due to flooding in the monsoon period. People living along these rivers especially low-lying areas, informal settlements, fragile houses, and those who have lowincome status and a number of dependent family members to care for, are highly vulnerable to flooding. </div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>NRCS has undertaken extensive household data collection along the flood plains of Karnali, Babai &amp; West Rapti River basins 2021-2022. The analysis shows that 33,794 families are living in Tikapur Municipality, Janaki Rural Municipality, Geruwa Rural Municipality, Rajapur Municipality and Madhuwan Municipality along the Karnali river. Likewise, 25,247 families are living in Barbardiya Municipality, Thakurbaba Municipality, Madhuwan Municipality and Gulariya Municipality along the Babai River. And 21032 families are living in Rapti Sonari Rural Municipality, Duduwa Rural municipality, and Narinapur Rural Municipality along the West Rapti.</div>\r\n<div> </div>",

The epicenter of the earthquake was at Lamidanda, Jajarkot. Several aftershocks are being experienced till date. According to the Nepal Government, there is a death of 157 people and 205 injured in Jajarkot and Rukum West districts. Atleast 14,000 houses are affected in those areas. Due to the remoteness of affected areas, communication inturruption and road blockage, it is being difficult to get the actual updates and transport relief materials. Continuous aftershocks have forced people to leave houses and stay in open spaces. However, Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) EOC team is regularly coordinating the district chapters' focal persons to get the updated information. NRCS Sectoral focal persons are also actively engaged in the earthquake response activities.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-margin-top-alt: auto; mso-margin-bottom-alt: auto; background: white;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: Poppins; color: black; mso-ansi-language: EN-GB; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB;\">NRCS volunteers and staff are actively engaged in search and rescue from day one. The injured people are being referred to district hospitals and hub hospital Surkhet and Nepalgunj. Now, NRCS district chapter is conducting Initial Rapid Assessment (IRA). Nepal Government (NEOC) has also provided sole responsibility to NRCS for assessment process. For technical support, NRCS EOC has deployed three ERT (Emergency Response Team) members in each of the districts.  Two Psychosocial Support (PSS) volunteers are also mobilized in the affected districts. They have already reached to affected districts and they have been continuously supporting the affected people and colleting data and sending to EOC. Similarly, EOC meeting on 4 November at 8 am decided to dispatch relief items: blanket (1200 pcs), tarpaulin (1200 pcs), mattress (1200 pcs), plastic rope (800 pcs) and plastic bucket (200 pcs) in two affected districts. 250 dead body bags were also sent in the affected districts. In addition, 200 pcs of mattressess will be promptly handed over to two district hospitals.</span></p>",

The epicenter of the earthquake was at Lamidanda, Jajarkot. Several aftershocks are being experienced till date. According to the Nepal Government, there is a death of 133 people and 140 injured in Jajarkot and Rukum West districts. More than 4,000 houses are affected in those areas. Due to the remoteness of affected areas, communication inturruption and road blockage, it is being difficult to get the actual updates and transport relief materials. Continuous aftershocks have forced people to leave houses and stay in open spaces. However, Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) EOC team is regularly coordinating the district chapters' focal persons to get the updated information. NRCS Sectoral focal persons are also actively engaged in the earthquake response activities.<br /></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 105%; font-family: 'Segoe UI',sans-serif; background: white;\">NRCS volunteers and staff are actively engaged in search and rescue from the mid-night. The injured people are being referred to district hospitals and hub hospital Surkhet and Nepalgunj. Now, NRCS district chapter is conducting Initial Rapid Assessment (IRA). Nepal Government (NEOC) has also provided sole responsibility to NRCS for assessment process. For technical support, NRCS EOC has deployed three ERT (Emergency Response Team) members in each of the districts.  Two Psychosocial Support (PSS) volunteers are also mobilized in the affected districts. They are on their way to affected districts. Similarly, EOC meeting on 4 November at 8 am decided to dispatch relief items: blanket (1200 pcs), tarpaulin (1200 pcs), mattress (1200 pcs), plastic rope (800 pcs) and plastic bucket (200 pcs) in two affected districts. 250 dead body bags were also sent in the affected districts. In addition, 200 pcs of mattressess will be promptly handed over to two district hospitals. </span></p>",

The top 10 districts account for 88 % of all reported cases (6,398 cases), while the cases are sporadic in other districts. These top 10 districts include Sunsari (4,679), Dhading (829), Kaski (214) Darchula (191), Kathamandu (119), Jhapa (81) Sankhuwasabha (75), Dhankuta (74) Morang (72) and Kanchanpur (64). The mortality of seven dengue cases has been verified, with one case associated with severe dengue shock syndrome, and the remaining six cases resulting from dengue along with other comorbidities. The situation is expected to further deteriorate in coming months due to the monsoon rain and humid climate which is most fertile environment for mosquito breeding. Since monsoon is continued, and continuous rainfall accumulated stagnant water in all affected districts and communities. So there is a high possibilities of Dengue transmission in coming months.",

Since then, dengue cases have been gradually reported in Nepal, with an outbreak in the year 2019 (n=17,992) reported from 68 districts and in 2022 (n=54,784) from all 77 districts. According to EDCD of MoHP, among the total of 54,000 cases, majority of dengue cases (n=28109) including 38 deaths happened between January to September 2022 coinciding with the peak rainy season in the country. This is indicative of exponential surge in dengue cases during July/ September considering the overall weather conditions and monsoon season which provides hibernating infected mosquitoes with an optimal environment for breeding. Until epidemiological week 29 (first week of August 2023, EWARS report, EDCD), 7,253 dengue cases has already been diagnosed which is highly alarming as this is the very first time that dengue has occurred in the consecutive year in contrary to the usual cyclical pattern of dengue incidence in Nepal. In addition, dengue incidence started even during winter season and is in increasing trend. According to a mathematical modelling projection conducted by WHO (2022), the projection shows that cases have already exceeded the alert threshold since beginning of 2023 when compared to the reported dengue cases in EWARS, indicating Dengue outbreak in Nepal. Since dengue is relatively new for Nepal, there is low level of knowledge and awareness among people. Even the priority for dengue prevention was less priority in the country until last year, Nepal government has been sincerely trying to address the emerging trend of dengue through joint planning and implementation from this year. Therefore, Nepal government, municipal authority to the national level, have requested NRCS for better coordination and collaboration in dengue prevention and response to the current outbreak. \nFurthermore, Dengue has disparate effect on different population strata. While pregnant and lactating women, children and elderly population are vulnerable to dengue, young adult population working outside (with low socio-economic status) have higher exposure risk to dengue infected vectors. The number of hospitalized cases has increased exponentially overwhelming the health facilities in Sunsari district. The current daily average cases shows that similar situation might be experienced in the affected districts in coming weeks or months. \nLikewise, the supply of blood (Platelets-rich Plasma-PRPs) will be the challenge to meet the demand. Because of all these factors the severity and mortality cases will be increased in the country.

While pregnant and lactating women, children and elderly population are vulnerable to dengue, young adult population working outside (with low socio-economic status) have higher exposure risk to dengue infected vectors. Hence, the number of hospitalized cases will be increased in coming 3-4 months and hospital facilities will be overwhelmed. Likewise, the supply of blood (Platelets-rich Plasma-PRPs) will be the challenge to meet the demand. Because of all these factors the severity and mortality cases will be increased in the country. In addition, the urban design of major cities in Nepal lacks in infrastructural public health aspects along with challenging waste management system and poor sanitation facilities which provides vectors with optimal environment for breeding. People residing in slums, densely populated urban cities with poor sanitation facilities are at greater risk of being affected. Hence, exponential rise in dengue cases can not only overwhelm health systems but also affect the most vulnerable population with low socio-economic conditions.",

There is probability of hot wind and head wave; therefore, awareness raising campaigns are being launched in those areas. Radios and Televisions are announcing the precautions to save from heat and Red Cross volunteers are orienting and distributing IEC materials in those target areas. Due to high population density with concrete built-up areas in the urban areas, the daily wages workers, women, children, elderly people and chronic illness people are most vulnerable and need special attention as well. Heatwaves is not only affecting the health of people but also their livelihoods.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">NDRRMA (National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority) under Ministry of Home Affairs have developed and disseminated Heat wave preparedness and response plan 2024. Local Governments of affected and to be affected areas are also coordinating with Red Cross and other relevant stakeholders for saving the lives of people from hot wind and heat wave.</p>",

NRCS is closely coordinating with the WAS cluster. In 29 June, NRCS shared an initial plan for response with IFRC and partners and an initial coordinating meeting was held on 30 June 2022. The second coordination meeting was held on 1 July 2022 and NRCS requested the IFRC for DREF Support.

            "description": "Due to unseasonal rainfall since Sunday, 17 October 2021 in different parts of the country, floods, and landslides have struck again in Nepal, where Baitadi, Kalikot, Doti, Dadeldhura, Darchula, Bajhang, Kailali, Sindhuli, Udayapur, Bhojpur, Illam Dhunkuta, Panchthar, Humla, Sunsari, Jhapa, and Kanchanpur districts reported 77 fatalities, 26 missing and 31 injured in the last two days. Water levels in the Mahakali, Bheri, Karnali, Koshi, Gandaki, West-Rapti and other rivers are likely to rise further this week because of heavy rains. Meanwhile, rainfall has caused damages at different road sections and bridges along the main highways at various locations, affecting the relief responses. Also, electricity, telephones, and the internet are interrupted in different districts. \n\nData of last two days shows that a total of 5,415 families are affected, 3385 families have been displaced and 2,022 households (fully 576 and partially 1446) have been damaged across 17 districts (Baitadi, Kalikot, Doti, Dadeldhura, Darchula, Bajhang, Kailali, Sindhuli, Udayapur, Bhojpur, Illam Dhunkuta, Panchthar, Humla, Sunsari, Jhapa, and Kanchanpur districts). The displaced families are residing in public buildings, schools, and neighborhoods. Displaced families have lost access to water points and sanitation facilities, increasing the risk of health problems, water-borne diseases, and the spread of COVID-19 infection in the community. Rescue, evacuation, and assessment are still ongoing in affected districts. (The number of people affected and displaced might change). Moreover, according to different local governments, there is rising in the number of people and households affected by the calamity. The flood and landslide have caused damage to crops and livestock in the affected districts. This month (October-November) was the peak hour to harvest the crops at the field. Nepal is an agricultural country having 66 percent of people directly engaged in farming. Farming is subsistent in nature and crop is mostly integrated with livestock. \n\nAccording to the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), generally to mostly cloudy in the rest of the country for a couple of days at many places of Province 1, Province 2, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province and at a few places of Lumbini Province, Karnali Province, and Sudur Pashchim Province, chances of heavy rainfall at one or two places of Province 1, Province 2, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province.",

            "description": "Monsoon 2021 started in the early of June for this year. With the beginning of the heavy rain since 15 June 2021 across the nation, there was a massive flood and landslides in many parts of Nepal which have caused human casualties, damage to infrastructure, crops, and livestock. In most cases, the houses were swept away and buried under the landslide debris. Till date, a total of 802 families are affected, 594 families have been displaced and 424 houses (fully 267 and partially 157) have been damaged across 20 districts (Sindhupalchok, Lamjung, Manang, Myagdi, Parbat, Kaski, Chitwan, Bajhang, Gorkha, Doti, Banke, Jumla, Palpa, Syangja, Kalikot, Rupandehi, Kavrepalanchwok, Argakhanchi, Pyuthan, and Saptari). As of 20 June 2021, 17 deaths (Male-12 and Female-5) have been reported, 22 are missing and 7 are injured. Due to the increased water level and current of rivers after the incessant rainfall meanwhile has caused damages at different road sections and bridges along the main highways at various locations, affecting the relief responses. The local governments mainly are taking the lead in responding to the incidents, with the support of communities and other humanitarian organizations. According to the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), light to moderate rain is likely to occur at many places of the country, chances of heavy rain with thunder and lightning are possible at a few places of Province 1, Province 2, and Bagmati Province and more than two places of the country. Based on the forecast, the alert letter has been sent to districts by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA). Additionally, the Government also has the provision to send the alert SMS to the population around the river embankments in case the water level crosses the danger level.\n\nNRCS district chapters immediately informed all subchapters and mobilized for further response support activities like assessment, search and rescue, and immediate relief distribution. NRCS district chapters and sub-chapters are working closely with the concerned local government, District Disaster Management Committee (DDMC), and other agencies. Initial Rapid Assessment (IRA) is completed in Sindhupalchowk, Manang, Myagdi, Kaski, Parbat, Chitwan, and Lamjung districts. 10 sub-chapters volunteers were mobilized by concerned District Chapters to support the assessment and further for relief support distribution. The first aid services are on standby position to support injured people. As of 20 June 2021, NRCS has distributed 15 sets of non-food relief items to the affected families together with 78 tarpaulins, 50 sets of utensils, 20 buckets, 30 mattresses, and 54 blankets in the Sindhupalchwok, Chitwan, and Manang district.\n\nNRCS Emergency Operation Centre (EOC) is functional since 15 June 2021 to respond to Flood and Landslide situation. Currently, the NRCS team is also working collectively in the EOC for coordinating all relief efforts for flood and landslide responses. In addition, a number of floods and landslides that occurred since 15 June 2021 have drawn and swept away many houses in specific pocket areas of several districts and affected families are staying with their relatives, and many of them are staying in nearby schools and other temporary shelters. As result, shelter item remains one of the top-priority needs in affected areas. Likewise, displaced families have lost their water points and sanitation facilities which may aggravate the additional risk of health as well as COVID-19 and water-borne diseases. Health, clean drinking water, sanitation facilities, livelihood promotion, protection along with health and hygiene promotion support is needed in the flood and landslide affected areas. NRCS headquarters is keeping additional National Disaster Response Team (NDRT) members on standby for deployment as needed. IFRC Nepal country office, in close coordination with the NRCS, in-country Movement partners is monitoring the situation regularly. A joint team comprising staff from NRCS and IFRC is working together to develop a Pro-forma emergency plan of action (EPOA) and budget in case there is a need to request DREF funding to assist more affected people. Danish Red Cross team is closely working together with the NRCS team to collect IRA reports, consolidate reports and prepare daily situation reports and IFRC is supporting NRCS to update the GO platform among Movement Partners. Currently, NRCS received USD 50,000 (fifty thousand) from American Red Cross Quick Action Fund (QAF) to respond to floods and landslides in Sindhupalchowk, Lamjung, and Manang districts.",

Recently, following heavy rainfall on the October-first week of 2022, three provinces, namely Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudhurpaschim reported incidents of flooding and landslides. The initial assessments by Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) through its provincial and district chapters in affected provinces for these recent floods and landslides indicate that 375 houses have been reported fully damaged, with further 3,227 houses partially destroyed. In addition, around 15,555 families are affected including 13,101 families temporarily displaced. Nepal Government authorities have reported 19 people have died, 10 injured, and over 9 missing, while further search and rescue are underway. The scale of this disaster calls for an immediate major relief response from the government and other in-country agencies. Likewise, as the harvesting season is near, hundreds of acres of farming fields have reportedly been damaged and destroyed. The detailed assessment with coordinated efforts by NRCS including relief agencies to ascertain the extent of the damage is underway. The department of hydrology and meteorology has issued warnings for heavy rain in several provinces including the rising of water levels in major rivers. Also, predicting still possible rain in some areas.</span></p>",
