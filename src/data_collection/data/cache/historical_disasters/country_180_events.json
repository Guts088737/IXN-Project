In July, the Public Health Service (BOG) intensified dengue prevention activities by, among other things, increasing spraying activities. On August 24, 2023, Stephanie Cheuk-Alam, head of the Environmental Inspectorate of the Bureau of Public Health (BOG) reports in conversation with the Communication Service Suriname that the increase in dengue cases is partly due to the type 3 dengue that is now mainly going around.\n\n“There are four different types of dengue and all four occur in Suriname, but at the moment it is mainly type 3 that is now being spread,” says the chief inspector. She indicates that this type of dengue virus was not present in Suriname for 21 years. That is, no one has been exposed to the virus for 21 years. Now a large part of the Surinamese population, especially young people under 20, is vulnerable to this type of dengue. The result of this is therefore an increase in the number of dengue cases.\n\nWork is currently underway to identify the locations where the cases come from and to tackle them by means of spraying. “We are in a difficult situation now because the reporting from the doctors is not optimal,” says Cheuk-Alam. It is the intention that the dengue cases reported by the doctors are reported to the epidemiology department at the BOG. The various laboratories are being contacted to at least find out in which neighborhoods there are infections. The BOG tries to find out as much as possible if the infected people are from a certain neighbourhood, if it concerns a group that works in a place or a group of people who do not live together, but who became infected during a trip. This is because the intervention must take place systematically. The spray only kills the adult mosquitoes and frequent large-scale spraying increases the chance that the mosquito will become resistant to the product.\n\n",

On August 24, 2023, Stephanie Cheuk-Alam, head of the Environmental Inspectorate of the Bureau of Public Health (BOG) reports in conversation with the Communication Service Suriname that the increase in dengue cases is partly due to the type 3 dengue that is now mainly going around.\n\n“There are four different types of dengue and all four occur in Suriname, but at the moment it is mainly type 3 that is now being spread,” says the chief inspector. She indicates that this type of dengue virus was not present in Suriname for 21 years. That is, no one has been exposed to the virus for 21 years. Now a large part of the Surinamese population, especially young people under 20, is vulnerable to this type of dengue. The result of this is therefore an increase in the number of dengue cases.\n\nWork is currently underway to identify the locations where the cases come from and to tackle them by means of spraying. “We are in a difficult situation now because the reporting from the doctors is not optimal,” says Cheuk-Alam. It is the intention that the dengue cases reported by the doctors are reported to the epidemiology department at the BOG. The various laboratories are being contacted to at least find out in which neighborhoods there are infections. The BOG tries to find out as much as possible if the infected people are from a certain neighbourhood, if it concerns a group that works in a place or a group of people who do not live together, but who became infected during a trip. This is because the intervention must take place systematically. The spray only kills the adult mosquitoes and frequent large-scale spraying increases the chance that the mosquito will become resistant to the product.\n\n",

Due to this, the hydro plant build in this river is forces to discharge great amounts of excess water causing villages in the downstream of the hydro plant to flood.\nThe height of the flood water in these villages reached between 4 to 6 meters leaving houses covered with water until the roof of the house and especially leaving the agricultural plots of the village members blank.\nPrognoses of the MET office is that heavy rainfalls will continue until the end of August (The big rainy season in Suriname  is from 15 April - August 15). With the effects of Climate change it is not sure if we can still relay on this season pattern as we have seen that it was raining from since June 2021 (Suriname did not real had dry season last year and this year). Also from the MET office we are dealing with the ITCZ and La Nina phenomena causing more rain to fall.

            "description": "MAY 25, 2022: The government has declared the affected areas a disaster area as a result of the flooding in the interior. At a government press conference held, President Chan Santokhi indicated that he would sign a presidential decree to officially designate the areas as disaster areas.\nThe president indicates that it was also considered if a state of emergency had to be declared. This has been waived because a state of emergency would mean that people would have to be evacuated and economic activities would have to stop. \n\nDue to heavy rainfall \nSuriname has had excessive rainfall since March this yeas (See previous Go reports). The weather forecast indicates there is a high risk of further flooding due to continuing moderate to\nintense rainfall from ITCZ activity, that may be enhanced by a stationary upper level trough in the\nAtlantic Ocean. This is causing the areas in the interior and southern sections of Suriname and the coastal areas in the districts of Brokopondo, Sipaliwini, Marowijne, Para, Saramacca, Coronie and Nickerie to flood.\nFor now there are no changes in the forecast , then previous mentioned that rainfall might be until august this year.\n\nFor now there are no numbers of affected persons in these areas except for the the numbers the SRCS has of 457 families (Assessment done 29 April - May first in District Brokopondo) \n\nJune 7; As rain continues to fall. the foresaid areas are still flooded including new areas as in the capital city of Paramaribo, district Nickerie, Wageningen and Coronie, Albina in Marowijne. These flood water mostly retreats within a day of two at most one week, depending on the weather and rainfall. For these areas it is not know what the damage is and the number of affected persons.",

            "description": "As the rains still continues, large parts of the capital Paramaribo have also been flooded in addition to the previous areas that were underwater. The site of the Surinamese Red Cross has also had to deal with this flooding. In most places the water has receded.\nThe President of the country of Suriname, together with the Minister of Public Works and the Coordinator of the National Disaster Management Coordination Center (NCCR) have visited the flooded areas in Paramaribo, and also indicated that urgent crisis measures are needed. The NCCR has been instructed to evacuate people who cannot stay in their homes and where an unhygienic situation has arisen. It has also been indicated that houses need to be renovated. Temporary reception facilities will be created.\n\nThe other areas mentioned in previous Go reports are still suffering from the flooding. Also because of the continuous rains, the water level in the river varies and many households and their agricultural plots are still underwater.\n\nClimate outlook for Suriname (www.auraeopus.org), the long rainy season will last until August 2022 and the Inter tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) will migrates above Suriname during this period. The La Nina conditions will continues. The season will be wetter than usual and there will be an increase in wet spills May to July). The outlook also predicts potential flooding",

Suriname is now in the peak of the rainy season and top of that the hurricane season will start which is known that this season also brings a lot of rain. The NOAA is forecasting lots of rain in de coming days / weeks which will cause even more damage as what it is doing now. \nAll 10 districts (Paramaribo, Nickerie, Coronie, Saramacca, Commewijne, Wanica, Para, Marowijne, Sipaliwini, Brokopondo) has reported flooding in most of their communities (Government officials and Multimedia). The population affected might range from 200.000 to 250.000 people in the total of Suriname. A formal situation report / Damage & needs assessment does not exist at this time. (The country is an a severe economic crisis (no specific fund, The country is going through its third wave of Covid-19. Health care is on code black and the government is busy with vaccination campaigns.). For the SRCS there are no funds available to carry out an thorough assessment other that doing it by digital means (Phone and whatsapp, phoning volunteers and CDRT's to assess the situation and give some guidance and preparations and small response.\nCause of the flooding: Extreme rain fall / High tide in the rivers.  Some areas are known to the flooding to the inferior / bad drainage system or community built on low areas (mostly the urban areas als Paramaribo, Nickerie etc). Also due to the heavy rains the river can overflow causing flooding in communities (communities in rural areas such as Marowijne, Sipaliwini). \n  How have the population been affected\n- Damage to house and and household\n- damage crops (some areas are agriculture areas/ in the rural communities they do horticulture\n- loss income (For the households farming and doing horticulture)\n- possible health issues (today may 25 from government official that Cholera outbreak may be possible). Also if we think of Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya and water-born diseases etc\n\nAs said before the assessments are not done and or data is not available at this time for final figures and the damage and needs of the affected populations \n The SRCS will surge for funds / DREF if necessary so it can carry out assessment in order to be able to draft a plan of action ",

These persons migrated to Suriname in the hope to have a better (economical ) life and some as said fled because of the \"political depression faced tin their homeland. Most of these persons who are gather at the border have sought the refugees status at the UNHCR office at the Suriname Re Cross Head Quarters. The other have have the illegal status in country.\nThe population movement is the direct effect of the change in presidency in the United states as where President Elect Mr. Joe Biden  to ease the immigration policy.\n\nThe group of migrants who have gathered at the border in the district Nickerie (approximately 300 Km from the capital city Paramaribo and 40 km from the main city in New Nickerie) are not able to cross the border because of the Covid_19 measures as the borders are closed since March 2020. Both governments (Suriname & Guyana ) intended to open it up around December 13, 2020. At this area there is a fairy crossing each day.\nAt the moment these people are in a dire situation as the facilities for accommodation are absent. They camp in tents that they have brought themselves, but the area around them is used to make use of sanitation. The government fears that it will be a major unsanitary situation and that it will lead to a humanitarian crisis. Taking also in consideration the risk of the spreading of Cocid-19.\nAt this time other information is not available than that the group as what is said in the newspaper can get violently if  the government in anyway can not meet their demand or tries at any time to remove them with force. On government level discussions are taken place. The SRCS is taken part in these discussions at that level.\nAt the level of the NDO the SRCS has been asked to assist (Refief distribution). At this point the SRCS is monitoring the situation and is not yet taken actions. We are awaiting the needs assessment. More info will be added as soon this comes available\n\n\n\n ",

            "description": "No situations worth mentioning have occurred today. This issue has the full attention of the government. The crowed is under control and for the time being the situation is not likely to get out of hand. The authorities are investigating how a large part of the Cubans who want to cross the South Drain to Guyana could come to Suriname illegally.\n\nA quick scan of the persons on the move:\n-\t364 Cubans (236 male, 118 female)\n-\t3 Dominicans\nInclusive of 3 pregnant women, 8 mothers with 10 children\n\nStatus (information immigration dept)\n-\tAsylum seekers: 71\n-\tStay permit:27 \n-\tIllegal: 209\n\nMeasures taken by the government in order not to worsen the situations:\n-\tall flights from Cuba and Haiti have been temporarily put on hold. \n-\tThe checkpoints on the Paramaribo-Nickerie section have now been upgraded. Persons with an illegal status caught at these check points will be irrevocably arrested and detained. \n-\tAn investigation will commence. Document verification showed that the majority of persons resided illegally in Suriname, some are registered as refugees. The possibility of human trafficking and smuggling cannot be ruled out\nHumanitarian aid is being offered to the group of foreigners (By the NDO). \n-\tproviding people who were scattered in tents over the ferry square and the vicinity of the ferry terminal with better sleeping accommodation;\n-\tsanitary facilities, medical facilities (doctors are on site);\n-\tfood (Toiletpaper, Nutrilon babymilk, Water, bread &spreads, milk) at this moment it was provided December 3. It is not said whether they will receive for the rest of the period\n\nComments from the protesters (information from the NDO)\n-\tPeople have indicated that they want to stop the protest and return to the capital city.\n-\tHusband indicates that his wife has weakened due to a lack of nutrition and will probably have to leave the protest\n-\tFrom since the start of the protect a mother says that her child only ate yogurt (The reason was not clear)\nCoordination at Gov. level\n-\tCoordination team has been set up consisting of a number of ministers to deal with this matter. \n-\tThe international community has also been informed about the situation \n-\tTechnical assistant is provided to the Gov. by organizations with experience of similar problems and situations. UNHCR, IOM and Red Cross).\n-\t Discussions with the neighboring country Guyana, as people want to move to the neighboring country.\n\nThe Cuban ambassador has also been summoned and formally informed of the situation, all of which has been recorded in a diplomatic note. The Caricom and the Organization of American States will also be notified in the coming period. \n\nHow long the situation will last is not clear. This might depend on the decision from both Suriname and Guyana. IF the situation will still be under control depends on the decision of the Governments and or their food supply which will decrease as we don’t know how long this situation will last.\nComing out from the assessment (information received from the NDO) Food supply, water and nutrition for the children will be the main need that should be addressed (as it is not clear how long the situation will last) \n\nFor now the SRCS is still monitoring the situation as the Government has the situation under control and will focus on understanding the needs so we can decide whether an humanitarian intervention is needed. \nThe SRCS is in constant collaboration with the NDO and provides technical advice where needed. \n",

            "description": "Third update population movement Suriname - Guyana. December 5 - December 10, 2020.  to date the group of 367 most Cuban descendants have put up a camp at the border with Guyana called Southdrain (the crossing via custom office to Guyana) Because of the Covid-19 pandemic the borders were closed. The border with Guyana were set to open on the 12th of December 2020. Officially this date is postponed by both governments. Guyana officially stated not willing to give passage to the group of Cubans. As come to know the final destiny of the group on the move is to enter the united states. The Cubans have been forced to travel to Georgetown, Guyana to apply for a US visa. This as quoted from the newspaper \"Starnieuws dated December 9, 2020: Washington has closed its embassy in Cuba for some time, partly due to the 'Havana syndrome. The Cuban Embassy in Georgetown believes that Washington has provoked the situation in which Cubans travel to Suriname, among other things, to continue to Guyana.\"\n\nSuriname has officially informed International partners Such as IOM, UNCHR, Caricom, OAS, US and Cuba Embassy of the situation in Suriname. To this point no solution has been found.  In a statement, the Cuban Embassy says that in their attempt to reach the US or other countries by illegal routes, Cubans are becoming victims of human traffickers and criminal gangs operating in the region. With Covid-19 in mind, any displacement of such groups poses an epidemiological risk. The Cuban ambassador has taken note of the concentration of his fellow countrymen on the border of Suriname who want to enter Guyana illegally in order to travel on to the US. The ambassador has meanwhile held talks with the Guyanese authorities on this issue.\n\nOn the basis of the Cuban constitution, Cuba is prepared to receive all Cuban migrants who are in Guyana who wish to return. In these cases, the necessary consular assistance and guarantees for a voluntary and safe return will be provided, the Cuban ambassador noted. The Cuban government reaffirms its willingness to continue to work with Guyanese immigration authorities with the aim of putting in place effective working mechanisms to prevent Cuban citizens from continuing to use Guyanese territory as an illegal transit point to the United States or other countries.\n\nCuba also reiterates that Cuban citizens who have a residence permit for the country and have not had renewal and have an expired passport can also exceptionally return. This measure was passed in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic to support citizens stranded for reasons beyond their control.\n\nSuriname has requested Cuba to state in writing that if the persons are willing to repatriate to Cuba, they will not be prosecuted. Form source from the immigration office 170 persons have the illegal status. Until then they will stay in Suriname.\n\nIn collaboration with the NDO the Suriname Red Cross has executed an assessment to determent the needs. Because of their purpose of moving and the way they are organized the needs did not fully come forward. They refused any assistance from the Government, Red Cross or other organisations. At the question what kind of assistance they need the reply of each of was \"Nada solo irme!\" (\"Nothing, just to leave\"). The assessment carried out thou gave a better idea of the people who were there. The group consisted of 233 male and 118 female (not everybody felt the need to register).  The age groups \n\tAge group\t\t\t\t\t\n\t0- 11 \t1 to 4\t5 to 14\t15 - to 49\t50 - 59\tover 60\n\t3\t       4\t        6\t         318\t                12\t         3\n\nReproductive\nPregnant 4; not sure 2, Lactating 6 and reproductive age 108\n\nTheir livelihood when living in the city lay in working for / in Hair salons, Constructions, carwash, shopping malls, gardening, housekeeping etc. In the group there were also nurses and medical doctors. The salary range was between SRD 900 and 2500 ( IN USD 49 and 136) a month. 98% lived in a rented apartment. These varied from USD 136 to 250. Because of the economical depression Suriname faced in the last 5 years their living condition became worse where most of them could not afford food, medicine and or pay the rent. With the appearance of the covid-19 pandemic more that 60% was not able to work and provide in their daily living and were even threatened to be evicted from their rented apartment. Even in the covid-19 situation this group did not receive assistant from the government. Also the Assessment shown that a  20% of persons suffers from an illness and needs frequently medical attention (Illnesses such as Diabetic, hypertension, Asthma, skin decease, HIV(1).\nTo Make the journey to the USA they have sold all their belongings the bought through years working (Motor bike, car and other accessories.\n\nIt is not clear yet as what will happen to the beneficiaries know that is clear that the borders will not open for this group to leave as planned. Also it is at this moment not clear where the government will relocated this group. it is clear that they will not stay there (Southdrain) and that they will be removed. The Suriname Red Cross is asked for assistance in case this situation continues.\n\nDue to the fact that they have to return to the situation they have tried to avoid by moving away to better places the possibility exist that they can lapse into crime, prostitution, suicide attempts, abuse of power, domestic violence.\n\nDepending on the outcome of the decision by lawmakers, the Red Cross has developed three scenarios for which it will request possible funding to carry out a response if:\n- Placed in shelter with no possibility to provide for own meals - 1 month response food products to be provided for f.e. meal on wheels\n- Place in shelter with possibility to provide for own meals - 1 month response relief distribution of Food and Non food Items, Hygiene kits, mental care assistance\n_ Back in society - 3 months cash transfer assisting to get back on their feet (During this time find a job etc)\n\nThe plan will be developed and presented as deemed necessary.\n \n\n",

            "description": "The group of Cuban citizen who moved to the West border of of Suriname, Southdrain, and protested since than because they could not cross the border to continue their movement to Guyana has ended. As previous mentioned Guyana has refused  to open their border as planned on December 12. The Embassy of Cuba had mentioned that their citizen were free to return home. Suriname had requested a statement in writing that if the citizen were to return to Cuba they would be left unharmed. This statement in writing was never received. On December 17, 2020 the Police was forced to remove the protesters (Migrants ) because of violent behaviors, threat of deprivation of life. 225 persons (Others had left the group since it was clear that continuing the journey was not a possibility) were handed over to the immigration department and placed in a temporary shelter. Meanwhile, the 16 leaders have been locked up and will be deported to Cuba. The rest have been released and advised to take care of their documents (Illegal status).\nWith this government decision, the threat of population movement and the associated risks of, for example, human trafficking has been removed. Therefor there is no need for the Suriname Red Cross to be on standby and will therefor close the situation report. The SRCS will evaluate its assistance and cooperation to/with the NDO and if needed adjust.",
