In total, 8,000 people have been evacuated to their relatives or other accommodation facilities, and six people have lost their lives as a consequence of the disaster. Heavily affected regions inclide Upper Carniola, Central Slovenia, KoroÅ¡ka region, as well as Savinjska region.</p>\r\n<p>Bridges and roads are submerged in these areas, while water supply systems in KoroÅ¡ka and Savinjska have been compromised. Electricity supply is also disrupted in the KoroÅ¡ka and Savinjska regions. Some of the affected regions have already been impacted by extreme weather events over this summer, and some of the regions suffer from pre-existing socio-economic challenges. In the most affected areas, communication is disrupted and there is severe damage to infrastructure. Over 170 landslides are active, posing a continued threat to homes, infrastructure, and electricity. The government is continuing to evaluate the scope of the disaster, damage assessment via local actors is still ongoing. Affected population is provided with food, water and basic needs from the Civil Protection (CP) as well as Slovenian Red Cross (SRC) via air or with heavy vehicles operated by the Slovenian army or firefighters, with SRC also assisting them in the handover of relief items to the vulnerable population. On 11 August, the Ministry of Defense reported that by their first estimates more than 400 buildings (some including multiple housing units) were completely destroyed or declared uninhabitable. The loss of assets, homes and businesses, livestock, crops and infrastructure will affect job security and livelihoods in the mid-to long term. Because of the continuous threat of landslides, it is expected that more households will become in need of long-term shelter and basic needs support during the upcoming months.</p>",
