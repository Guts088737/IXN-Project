It arrived from South Indian Ocean, crossing above Madagascar and through Mayotte and Comoros. As of 16 December, Mozambique’s National Institute for the coordination of Disaster Risk Reduction (INGD) has identified more than 175 thousand people in humanitarian need. </p>\r\n<p>As of 16 December, the number of confirmed deaths and injured is 27 and 36 in TC affected provinces. More than 24,000 shelters have been completely destroyed, leaving several thousands of families without a home. While CVM’s Early Action Protocol has been activated prior to the TC landing, their distributions of shelter kits have not arrived on time to support families before impact. CHIDO has landed earlier than the expected TC season and with greater impact due to La Nina climate phenomenon. Additionally, the TC hit amid a very unprecedented and unstable political period in Mozambique history, with nationwide protests and civil unrest following the results of presidential election in October.  </p>",

        "summary": "<p>The IFRC Disaster Response Emergency Fund (DREF) has approved a total of CHF 549,929 for the implementation of the Mozambique Red Cross Flood EAP. The approved amount consists of an allocation of CHF 357,352 for readiness and prepositioning and CHF 192,578 allocated to implement early actions once the defined triggers are met. Allocations are made from the Anticipatory Pillar of the DREF, under the DREF appeal code MDR00001. Unearmarked contributions to the DREF are encouraged to guarantee enough funding is available for the Early Action Protocols being developed. This EAP is focused on floods, which might occur anywhere in Mozambique from October to April (the rainy/cyclone season). The actions proposed will be activated on the basis of hydro-meteorological warnings indicating that the trigger level (water level correspondent to discharge of five-year return period at the river basin reference station) will be reached within 72 hours (3 days), which is the lead time within which the CVM can act in advance before a flood event reaches the districts and communities potentially at risk. All actions included in the EAP are based on this preparation time window.</p>\r\n<p>The hydro-meteorological forecast will be provided by the National Institute of Meteorology (INAM), the National Directorate of Water Resources Management (DNGRH) and by REPRESA project through GloFAS, with whom the FbF team has developed longstanding collaboration at the technical level, focusing on the provision of data, as well as providing forecasts in a timely manner. This EAP seeks to achieve two objectives: first to ensure that the selected early actions are evidencebased and that they are effective in reducing the prioritized humanitarian impact of floods in Mozambique. Actions are proposed on the basis of sound risk information (Chapter 3), and reliable climate information that events of a certain magnitude are linked to high levels of impact. Secondly, the protocol describes how CVM selected and will organize the actions. G</p>\r\n<p>eographical scope - the present EAP covers four Mozambican hydrographic basins: Limpopo, Buzi, Zambezi and Licungo with special focus on the at-risk districts downstream, in total 12: Gaza Province; Chokwe, Guija, Chibuti, Limpopo, Sofala Province; Buzi, Caia, Marromeu. Zambezia Province: Mocuba, Namacurra, Maganja da Costa, Mopeia and Luabo. The target population are those communities living along the flood plains particularly in the provinces of Gaza, Sofala and Zambezia.</p>",

This protocol was developed based on extensive research and consultations with stakeholders at the national, provincial, district, and community levels in areas highly susceptible to cyclones. The selection of actions to be taken in the EAP was guided by several criteria, such as whether it aligns with the Disaster Risk Management System in Mozambique, the ability of the Cruz Vermelha de Mozambique (CVM) to execute the action (including the presence of volunteers), and whether the community craftsman and the CLGRC can support the CVM in its implementation. Other factors considered were the action's effectiveness in reducing the impact of the cyclone, the shelf life of NFIs required, and whether it can benefit communities even in the absence of a cyclone.</p>\r\n<p>The EAP will be implemented by CVM in coordination and collaboration with other stakeholders, early actions early warning working group, Disaster Management Authority (INGD) and with technical support from IFRC. The EAP can in principle be used nationwide, however, activation is anticipated to be concentrated in coastal districts in northern and central Mozambique with possibility to activate in 3 districts simultaneously. Taking into consideration the physical context, logistics, and the capacity of the NS, an activation will at a maximum involve three districts and target 2000 households (10000 people).</p>\r\n<p>The EAP focuses on prioritizing the reinforcement of individual houses and primary schools built with local materials. These schools receive students from 1st to 5th grade. Another important objective of the plan is to prevent endemic diseases, especially reducing the incidence of diarrhoea and cholera after storms. These diseases only add to the vulnerability of the communities affected by cyclones.</p>",

The current predicted windspeeds (farthest known) are up to 108 km/h. The tropical storm may continue to build strength in the Mozambican channel before making landfall again in the central region of Mozambique. There is the prediction of one cyclone making landfall in Mozambique this season, with wind speeds similar to that of TC Idai. As such, the national Society is preparing for a worst-case scenario and for possible impact on Sofala, Nampula and Zambezia.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>",
