            "description": "<p><span style=\"font-family: Poppins, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;\">On October 7 th , 2023, the world woke up to yet another round of deadly violence and escalation of hostilities in and around Gaza. According to the official Ministry of Health report, as of 21:30 - October 9th - a total number of (704) fatalities including (254) women and children; and approx. (4000) injuries have been recorded in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This very serious escalation is happening in the context of the worst record in terms of the number of Palestinian fatalities, injuries and destruction of homes and properties by the Israeli Occupation Forces, as well as an unprecedented level of settler violence against the occupied Palestinian population and their properties. According to the United Nations OCHA in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), “the number of Palestinian fatalities throughout the occupied Palestinian territory in the first nine months of 2023 (233 fatalities) is almost two times higher than the figure for the same period in 2022 (131 fatalities) and has exceeded the total number of fatalities in 2022. With the recent escalation, it is expected that the humanitarian and protection crisis for the Palestinian people will only get worse. The compounded impact of 15 year of land, air and sea blockade of Gaza together with the recurring rounds of hostilities and attacks on Gazan civilian infrastructure, residential areas and livelihoods is quite devastating, both materially and psychologically. In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Palestinian people face a vast network of military checkpoints and blockades that hamper the movement of people and goods, including restricting access to humanitarian and medical services. Currently, Israel has imposed a complete closure of almost all Palestinian cities, towns and villages. PRCS’ emergency medical teams are prevented from carrying their humanitarian and lifesaving services, and they are frequently targeted by Israeli Occupation Forces and settler attacks</span></p>",

            "description": "<p>On October 7 th , 2023, the world woke up to yet another round of deadly violence and escalation of hostilities in and around Gaza. According to the official Ministry of Health report, as of 21:30 - October 9th - a total number of (704) fatalities including (254) women and children; and approx. (4000) injuries have been recorded in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This very serious escalation is happening in the context of the worst record in terms of the number of Palestinian fatalities, injuries and destruction of homes and properties by the Israeli Occupation Forces, as well as an unprecedented level of settler violence against the occupied Palestinian population and their properties. According to the United Nations OCHA in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), “the number of Palestinian fatalities throughout the occupied Palestinian territory in the first nine months of 2023 (233 fatalities) is almost two times higher than the figure for the same period in 2022 (131 fatalities) and has exceeded the total number of fatalities in 2022. With the recent escalation, it is expected that the humanitarian and protection crisis for the Palestinian people will only get worse. The compounded impact of 15 year of land, air and sea blockade of Gaza together with the recurring rounds of hostilities and attacks on Gazan civilian infrastructure, residential areas and livelihoods is quite devastating, both materially and psychologically. In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Palestinian people face a vast network of military checkpoints and blockades that hamper the movement of people and goods, including restricting access to humanitarian and medical services. Currently, Israel has imposed a complete closure of almost all Palestinian cities, towns and villages. PRCS’ emergency medical teams are prevented from carrying their humanitarian and lifesaving services, and they are frequently targeted by Israeli Occupation Forces and settler attacks</p>",

            "description": "<p>On October 7 th , 2023, the world woke up to yet another round of deadly violence and escalation of hostilities in and around Gaza. According to the official Ministry of Health report, as of 21:30 - October 9th - a total number of (704) fatalities including (254) women and children; and approx. (4000) injuries have been recorded in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This very serious escalation is happening in the context of the worst record in terms of the number of Palestinian fatalities, injuries and destruction of homes and properties by the Israeli Occupation Forces, as well as an unprecedented level of settler violence against the occupied Palestinian population and their properties. According to the United Nations OCHA in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), &ldquo;the number of Palestinian fatalities throughout the occupied Palestinian territory in the first nine months of 2023 (233 fatalities) is almost two times higher than the figure for the same period in 2022 (131 fatalities) and has exceeded the total number of fatalities in 2022. With the recent escalation, it is expected that the humanitarian and protection crisis for the Palestinian people will only get worse. The compounded impact of 15 year of land, air and sea blockade of Gaza together with the recurring rounds of hostilities and attacks on Gazan civilian infrastructure, residential areas and livelihoods is quite devastating, both materially and psychologically. In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Palestinian people face a vast network of military checkpoints and blockades that hamper the movement of people and goods, including restricting access to humanitarian and medical services. Currently, Israel has imposed a complete closure of almost all Palestinian cities, towns and villages. PRCS&rsquo; emergency medical teams are prevented from carrying their humanitarian and lifesaving services, and they are frequently targeted by Israeli Occupation Forces and settler attacks</p>",

According to the official Ministry of Health report, as of 21:30 - October 9th - a total number of (704) fatalities including (254) women and children; and approx. (4000) injuries have been recorded in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. This very serious escalation is happening in the context of the worst record in terms of the number of Palestinian fatalities, injuries and destruction of homes and properties by the Israeli Occupation Forces, as well as an unprecedented level of settler violence against the occupied Palestinian population and their properties. According to the United Nations OCHA in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), &ldquo;the number of Palestinian fatalities throughout the occupied Palestinian territory in the first nine months of 2023 (233 fatalities) is almost two times higher than the figure for the same period in 2022 (131 fatalities) and has exceeded the total number of fatalities in 2022. With the recent escalation, it is expected that the humanitarian and protection crisis for the Palestinian people will only get worse. The compounded impact of 15 year of land, air and sea blockade of Gaza together with the recurring rounds of hostilities and attacks on Gazan civilian infrastructure, residential areas and livelihoods is quite devastating, both materially and psychologically. In the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, Palestinian people face a vast network of military checkpoints and blockades that hamper the movement of people and goods, including restricting access to humanitarian and medical services. Currently, Israel has imposed a complete closure of almost all Palestinian cities, towns and villages. PRCS&rsquo; emergency medical teams are prevented from carrying their humanitarian and lifesaving services, and they are frequently targeted by Israeli Occupation Forces and settler attacks</p>",

Consequently, PRCS ceased its service provision as of 14/11/2023, compelling the medical and administrative staff to evacuate the area.<br>&bull; PRCS Al-Quds Hospital: Suffered substantial damage from the Israeli shelling surrounding it and the direct strikes on various parts of facilities and sections. Following a siege lasting over 14 days, operations were halted, leading to the displacement of its staff, patients, and approximately 14,000 persons southward on 14/11/2023. To date, the hospital remains non-operational. It had attended to (1,169) injuries from October 2023 until 11/11/2023.<br>&bull; North Gaza Branch and its EMS Center: Endured significant destruction due to relentless bombing by Israeli forces, rendering the provision of EMS services unfeasible.

An UNRWA clinic was adapted as a temporary base for providing EMS services in the North Gaza governorate.</div>\n<div class=\"VfPpkd-Bz112c-RLmnJb\">PRCS Branch and EMS Center: EMS and relief staff are operational 24/7 to respond to the humanitarian needs of both residents and displaced individuals within the governorate.

These attacks have led to casualties among the displaced seeking a safe refuge at the facility, with the numbers exceeding 7,000individuals. Not only has the facility sustained significant damages due to the bombings, but also the Israeli occupation forces have enforced a stringent blockade around the premises, severely restricting the movement of PRCS staff and hindering their capacity to execute their humanitarian mandate within the governorate. The continuous and direct attacks necessitated the evacuation of displaced individuals through a humanitarian corridor. This was devised to safeguard their lives, particularly after the tragic loss of (27) individuals during the siege due to Israeli targeting. Faced with logistical challenges in transporting the deceased civilian martyrs, the staff were forced to bury them within the grounds of Al-Amal Hospital.<br>&bull; Al-Amal Hospital: it has repeatedly been the target of military attacks by the Israeli occupation forces, leading to significant damage to different sections and floors and threatening the life of the PRCS staff and patients. The blockade of PRCS headquarters by the military has persisted for 33 consecutive days, accompanied by continuous gunfire and shortage of medical supplies, food, water and fuel, further complicating the humanitarian situation on the ground. After several attempts to bring in food and fuel, on 20/2/2024 the Israeli occupation allowed the entry of only 7,500 liters of fuel in coordination with the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) to operate the electricity generator<br>Rafah Governorate:<br>&bull; PRCS Branch and EMS Center: In response to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Rafah, where the displaced population exceeds 1.3 million, PRCS staff are dedicated to operating continuously to mitigate their hardships and respond to their humanitarian needs. Beyond offering emergency medical and EMS services, as well as relief support throughout the governorate, PRCS turned Al-Quds Field Hospital into a medical post because the occupation forces prevented the entry of equipment necessary to operate the field hospital. Additionally, PRCS is commissioned with the critical task of receiving, processing, and distributing aid consignments that arrive to the Gaza Strip through the Rafah border crossing, ensuring the efficient allocation of resources to PRCS centers and affiliated parties.</div>\n<div class=\"VfPpkd-Bz112c-RLmnJb\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"UdTY9 BwTYAc leDWne\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-location=\"1\">\n<div class=\"kO6q6e\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"ebT7ne sMVRZe\">\n<div class=\"F0pQVc\">​</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"FFpbKc\">\n<div>\n<div data-show-delay-ms=\"250\" data-append-to-body=\"false\" data-propagate-tooltip-mouseover-events=\"true\" data-anchor-corner=\"bottom-left\" data-enable-skip-handler=\"false\" data-popup-corner=\"top-left\">\n<div>\n<div class=\"VfPpkd-Bz112c-Jh9lGc\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"VfPpkd-Bz112c-RLmnJb\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"r375lc\">\n<div class=\"aJIq1d\" dir=\"rtl\" data-language-code=\"auto\" data-language-name=\"التعرّف التلقائي على اللغة\" data-text=\"\" data-crosslingual-hint=\"undefined\" data-location=\"1\" data-enable-toggle-playback-speed=\"true\">\n<div class=\"m0Qfkd\">\n<div class=\"VfPpkd-Bz112c-Jh9lGc\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"QcsUad BDJ8fb BLojaf sMVRZe wneUed\">\n<div class=\"usGWQd\">\n<div class=\"KkbLmb\">\n<div class=\"lRu31\" dir=\"rtl\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

            "description": "On 31 March, Israeli forces shot and killed two unarmed Palestinians, including a 16-year-old boy, and injured another twenty over the course of a search-and-arrest operation in Jenin refugee camp; an exchange of fire with Palestinians reportedly took place. On 1 April, a 28-year-old Palestinian man was shot and killed in the H2 area of Hebron city; according to Israeli media, he threw a Molotov cocktail at a structure where Israeli soldiers were positioned. No Israeli injuries were reported in the two incidents.\n2 Apr 2022:  Israeli forces shot and killed three Palestinians (24, 25, 30 YO) while in their vehicle at the junction of the town of Arraba, southwest of (Jenin). According to local sources, Israeli forces opened fire at the people in the vehicle after ramming it with their car, while Israeli media and military claim that they assassinated an armed cell responsible for shooting attacks against Israeli forces in Tulkarm area and were on their way to carry another attack. Following the shooting, Israeli forces prevented Palestinian paramedics from providing medical aid to the men who were by then dragged out of their vehicle and laid on the ground. Their bodies were all then confiscated and transferred out of the scene by an Israeli ambulance. The paramedics also reported that Israeli forces forced them to back off at gunpoint by pointing their gun lasers at them.\n•\tIn one incident, Israeli force shot and injured at least 35 Palestinians in the village of Qaryut, south of (Nablus), while the Palestinians attempted to deter an attack of Israeli settlers on the southern outskirts of the village. \n•\tIn separate incidents , Israeli settlers raided Palestinian farmland and destroyed 3 water tanks ,water network , one water tank was looted and cut 5m of fences surrounding the land in At Tuawni (south Hebron)  Ash Shuykh (Hebron) .\n•\tIsraeli settlers raided Palestinian farmland and uprooted/destroyed around 105 trees near Ash Shyukh (Hebron) and Kfar Qadum (Qalqiliya)\n•\tIn one incident Israeli settlers from Sedi Boaz  outpost raided Palestinian land in Al  Khadr and looted a mobile latrine and a water tank which was provided by NGOs to the Palestinian family .\n•\tIsraeli settlers attacked Palestinian herders and foreign activists and prevented them from accessing  the land and the grazing flocks near Dier Jerir (Ramallah) , Um Faggarah village(South Hebron)  , \n•\t Israeli settlers attacked Palestinian houses in Wadi aL Husain in H2  (Hebron),and Al Biereh, and damages were reported to a house and a vehicle.\nTensions in Israel and the Palestinian Territories had been increasing in the past few weeks. In March and April 2022, \nShortly before the incident, a Jewish extremist religious group called Returning to the Mount announced that it intended to perform Passover sacrifices on the Temple Mount during the Jewish holiday of Passover. On 14 April six members were arrested planning to sacrifice a goat on the Temple Mount. \n During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan the year before, nighttime demonstrations in Jerusalem and clashes at the Al-Aqsa compound had turned into an 11-day long war between Israel and Palestinian groups.\n On 15 April 2022, Israeli forces stormed Al-Aqsa Mosque using tear gas shells and sound bombs, injuring at least 59 Palestinians in the beginning of the clash. According to Israeli reports, dozens of Palestinians marched near the Western Wall and attacked police officers by throwing rocks at them. Some of the Palestinians barricaded themselves inside the Al-Aqsa mosque, where they were detained.  \"a number of occupation soldiers climbed on the roofs of buildings surrounding Al-Aqsa Mosque. They evacuated the courtyard of Al-Aqsa Mosque and closed most of the doors leading to it\". The clash resulted in over 150 Palestinians being injured and 400 arrested.",

It is also expected that the region will be exposed to an air depression of polar origin, and snow will fall at a height of more than 650 m, hail and heavy rain, and the wind speed may reach 80 km / hour, as the depression is expected to continue. For four consecutive days. The Meteorological Department warns that snow will accumulate from about 20-40 cm, especially in high areas whose height is more than 650 m above sea level. And the expected damage in the governorate is also soil slide, water pollution and agricultural crops, the collapse of weak and old buildings, road closures, electricity and communications loss and this cold wave will remain the same tell the med of March-2022. Therefore PRCS activated all the specialized volunteers in DRM and EMS, and updated all main warehouse and sub Warehouses and logistic needs and they start working in  the local communities to reduce the impact of the cold wave by means of assisting the affected families and providing the HH with Food and Non food items \" shelter, relief and WASH kits\"      ",

            "description": "•\tTensions in East Jerusalem have been escalating in recent weeks (since the start of Ramadan on 13th April), after the Israeli authorities installed metal barriers outside the Damascus Gate, blocking access to a public area for Palestinians.  Although a relative calm was restored with the removal of the obstacles on 25 April, tensions were further heightened by the Israeli authorities’ imminent eviction of four extended Palestinian former refugee families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem. Since 28 April, Palestinians have been holding daily protests in Sheikh Jarrah area in solidarity with the families at risk of eviction. Confrontations with Israeli settlers and Israeli forces were initially centred on Sheikh Jarrah and the Old City have spread to other parts of the city and also to mixed communities in Israel. \n•\tConfrontations have worsened substantially since 7 May, and there have been a number of marches, protests and “days of rage” with protests across West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as some in Palestinian communities in Israel.  Conforontations have led to violence with Israeli forces using tear gas, skunk water, rubber bullets, and live ammunition. PRCS has given first aid support to over 6000 people since 7 May. 27 people have lost their lives. Protests and confrontations are ongoing.\n•\tOn 10 May a number of rockets were released from Gaza, some coming close to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and Israeli forces responded with their own aerial bombardments. These led to significant injuries and casualties given the densely populated nature of the Gaza Strip. Israeli air sea and land forces launched aerial attacks against Gaza, whilst a number of rockets and mortar shells were fired from Gaza into Israel. The escalation of hostilities lasted 11 days, until 2am the morning of 21 May a cease fire entered into effect. Approx. 230 people killed in Gaza, around 65 of these children. Over 1700 people were injured including over 500 children. \n•\tAccording to the Ministry of Housing Over 250 buildings destroyed, and close to 2000 units were destroyed or so severely damaged so as to be unusable. 15,000 more units have had some damage.\n•\tOver 100,000 people were displaced, including around 70,000 seeking protection in UNRWA schools across Gaza and over 35,000 staying with host families. \n•\t58 education facilities were damaged. Nine hospitals and 9 primary healthcare centres have been also damaged. One hospital was not able to function due to lack of electricity for 5 successive days. The COVID testing centre was also damaged and had to stop functioning for a number of days. \n•\tThere is a huge concern that there will be an increase in COVID cases due to people being housed together in displacement shelters or being housed by other families and unable to maintain distancing measures, access the needed PPEs, lack of clean water etc. Less than 40,000 people in Gaza have been vaccinated.\n•\tProtests across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, continued after the cease fire. Whilst these have reduced in the last few days, the court decision regarding the evictions in Sheikh Jarrah is expected in two weeks.\n",

        "summary": "<p>Tensions in East Jerusalem have been escalating in recent weeks (since the start of Ramadan on 13 April), after the Israeli authorities installed metal barriers outside the Damascus Gate, blocking access to a public area for Palestinians. Although a relative calm was restored with the removal of the obstacles on 25 April, tensions were further heightened by the Israeli authorities’ imminent eviction of four extended Palestinian former refugee families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood of East Jerusalem. Since 28 April, Palestinians have been holding daily protests in Sheikh Jarrah area in solidarity with the families at risk of eviction, triggering confrontations with Israeli settlers and Israeli forces. Confrontations that were initially centred on Sheikh Jarrah and the Old City have spread to other parts of the city and in recent days to mixed communities in Israel.</p>\r\n<p>Confrontations have worsened substantially since 7 May, and on 11 May there was a “day of rage” with protests across West Bank, including East Jerusalem, as well as some in Palestinian communities in Israel. Protests and confrontations have continued since this time. The total number of cases dealt with by PRCS in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem up to 16:00 on 14 May, reached 2,426 cases. At the same time, there are concerns that there might be a spike in COVID cases following the Eid holiday.</p>\r\n<p>On 10 May a number of rockets were released from Gaza, some coming close to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv and Israeli forces responded with their rockets. These led to significant injuries and casualties given the densely populated nature of the Gaza Strip. The exchange of rockets and the bombardments of Gaza by Israeli air, sea, and land forces continues to this time.</p>\r\n<p>According to the health authorities in Gaza, up to noon on 14 May, 119 Palestinians have been killed, including 31 children and 19 women, and a further 869 people have been wounded since the start of the escalation on 10 May. The total number of cases dealt with by PRCS in Gaza since 10 May 2021, reached a total number of 572 injuries and 55 fatalities.</p>\r\n<p>Gaza authorities reported on 14 May that residential (14 towers) and commercial buildings, schools (29) and infrastructure, electricity network, water centres, and agricultural sites have sustained extensive damage. With over 500 housing units destroyed and around 2,100 with minor damage, there is a rapid increase in the number of displaced, estimated by the UN at over 10,000 people.</p>\r\n<p>Of immediate concern is the shutdown of Gaza’s sole power plant by the end of this week due to a shortage of fuel, with detrimental implications for the provision of essential services, such as health and WASH. The main electricity feeder line in Jabalia has been severely disrupted, increasing the number of lines that are currently out of service to four out of 12. Another critical challenge being that the North Gaza Seawater Desalination Plant is not operational for the fourth successive day, affecting access to water of 230,000 people.</p>\r\n<p>The current escalation risks exacerbating an already dire humanitarian situation, especially in Gaza, where the struggling health sector is further burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic. There are fears that the displacement of a large number of people who may need to live in crowded evacuation centres could lead to a spike in COVID cases.</p>",
