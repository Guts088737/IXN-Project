            "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"sr-Latn-BA\">On the night of October 3rd and early morning of October 4th, 2024, regions of Bosnia and Herzegovina were struck by intense rainfall, severely impacting the municipalities of Jablanica, Konjic, Fojnica, Kiseljak, and Kre&scaron;evo. The extreme weather triggered flash floods that surged with such force that they led to devastating landslides. In several locations, the landslides moved boulders weighing over 10 tons, crushing homes and damaging property.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"sr-Latn-BA\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"sr-Latn-BA\">The municipalities of Jablanica and Konjic experienced the most severe impact from the flash floods and landslides, while Kre&scaron;evo, Fojnica, and Konjic suffered substantial damage from the flash floods. Many communities in these municipalites were cut off and isolated due to the destruction of road networks and communication infrastructure, further complicating emergency response efforts. The most extensive damage was reported in Donja Jablanica and Zlate, both located within the municipality of Jablanica, and in Buturović Polje in the municipality of Konjic.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"sr-Latn-BA\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"sr-Latn-BA\">By October 11th, 2024, 23 fatalities had been confirmed, with five individuals still officially reported as missing. The flood's impact on households across affected municipalities was also severe, with 163 households in Jablanica, 200 in Konjic, 100 in Kre&scaron;evo, 170 in Fojnica, and 500 in Kiseljak affected by the disaster.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"sr-Latn-BA\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"sr-Latn-BA\">The situation remains critical in the municipalities of Jablanica and Konjic, where the removal of debris and boulders brought down by the landslides is still ongoing. The damage to infrastructure, including roads, bridges, and communication lines, is so extensive that full repairs are projected to take years. These infrastructural challenges, combined with the displacement of residents, necessitate urgent shelter solutions. Efforts are underway to establish container camps to house those who have lost their homes or cannot return to their residences due to unsafe conditions.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"sr-Latn-BA\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span lang=\"sr-Latn-BA\">Meanwhile, in Kre&scaron;evo, Fojnica, and Kiseljak, the focus remains on the immediate first response to the floods. Local efforts are directed toward addressing the basic needs of evacuees, mitigating health risks, and ensuring access to clean drinking water. Emergency response teams are working closely with local authorities to prevent potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases and to restore essential services. The coordinated efforts in these municipalities aim to stabilize the situation as quickly as possible, allowing communities to begin the recovery process.</span></p>",

In addition to the severe flooding, the municipality of Jablanica was further impacted by an earthquake, compounding the devastation.</p>\r\n<p>The combined effects of the flash floods and earthquake triggered a landslide in the Donja Jablanica region, completely destroying large parts of the area.

This number is not final, as several communities remain isolated and cut off from rescue and communication efforts due to the destruction of critical infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p>In the affected municipalities, schools have been canceled, and roads have been severely damaged, with many rendered completely impassable. In the Jablanica region, phone and internet connections are unavailable, further complicating coordination and rescue efforts.</p>\r\n<p>The situation remains fluid as rescue operations continue, and updated information is expected as access to the cut-off areas improves.</p>",

In addition to measles, cases of pertussis (whooping cough) and varicella (chickenpox) are also being recorded. Due to the increased number of cases, a measles epidemic was declared in Bijeljina in February 2024, followed by one in Banja Luka. According to official data from the Institute of Public Health of Republika Srpska, as of March 22, 2024, there have been 30 cases of measles and 125 cases of pertussis reported. The highest number of pertussis cases was recorded in Banja Luka, totaling 105. In the Brčko District of BiH, 28 cases of measles have been reported. According to official data, the vaccination rate is only 52%. According to official data from the Institute of Public Health of the Federation of BiH, in the last three months, from January to March 2024, a total of 1,329 cases of measles have been reported, with the highest number in the Sarajevo Canton (875 cases) and the Tuzla Canton (396 cases). Comparing monthly data, a significant increase can be observed from 76 cases in January 2024 to 289 cases in February and 906 cases in March 2024. Due to the deteriorating epidemiological situation in the Tuzla Canton, the Ministry of Health of the Tuzla Canton, upon the proposal of the Institute of Public Health of the Tuzla Canton, issued an order declaring a measles epidemic in the Tuzla Canton on February 23, 2024. In addition to measles, 69 cases of pertussis were recorded in the Tuzla Canton from January to March 2024. By the end of the first week of April, a total of 1,007 cases of measles had been reported in the Sarajevo Canton, mainly among children aged 1 to 4 years (42.4%), followed by the age group of 5 to 9 years (29%) and the age group of 10 to 14 years (11%). There were also 65 cases of measles reported among individuals aged 30 to 65 years. Due to the increased number of reported cases, a measles epidemic was declared in the Sarajevo Canton on February 10, 2024. In addition to the measles outbreak, the Sarajevo Canton has also been burdened with a higher number of pertussis cases. The Ministry of Health of the Sarajevo Canton declared an epidemic of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, on March 12 for the territory of the canton. A total of 112 cases of pertussis were recorded in the Sarajevo Canton from January to March 2024. Cases of pertussis were also reported in the Zenica-Doboj Canton, specifically 88 cases from January to March 2024. Hospital visits are prohibited due to this situation. Additional complications due to chickenpox: During the period from January to March 2024, a higher number of chickenpox cases were recorded, totaling close to 1,500 cases, with the highest numbers in the Sarajevo Canton (357), the Tuzla Canton (308), the Una-Sana Canton (296), and Herzegovina (260). These data represent the situation for January and February 2024. Vaccination coverage rate According to health authorities, less than 60% of the population is vaccinated against measles and rubella. In 2022, Bosnia and Herzegovina achieved a vaccination rate of 60% with two doses of the measles vaccine, which is significantly below the prescribed level of the World Health Organization. Due to the infodemic, an increasing number of young parents are deciding not to vaccinate their children out of fear of worsening their children's health conditions, autism, and the like. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, public trust in vaccines is decreasing, which is one of the reasons for the low vaccination rates and general acceptance of all vaccines. There is a need for considerable efforts to be made to promote and preserve health, emphasize the importance of immunization, and prevent diseases. Measures to mitigate the risk and contain the spread of the disease During the epidemic, measures provided for by laws on the protection of the population from infectious diseases will be implemented. These measures include education on the prevention of infectious diseases, early detection of sources of infection and transmission routes, reporting and isolation of the sick, hospitalization and treatment, as well as enhanced immunization of children, where the Red Cross in Bosnia and Herzegovina plays a significant role.",

The constant rise of the water level in these parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina presents a threat to a few thousand inhabitants in these areas. The sudden flood wave directly endangered the lives of almost ten households, and over 20 individuals had to be displaced from their homes. Following intense precipitation and flood waves, there are many landslides, while a significant part of road communication has been damaged. This course of action is especially hard for the population of the rural part of these areas, preventing their communication and aggravating the distribution of much-needed humanitarian aid for these populations.</p>",

As a result of the floods, almost 900 households were directly affected, while more than 10000 people were in danger. Due to floods, 50 people were displaced, while floods caused enormous damage to the environment in this part of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the region of Prijedor and Una-Sana Canton, rivers Una and Sana, as well as smaller tributaries, due to heavy rainfall, caused massive floods. Local authorities, assisted by volunteers of the Red Cross organization, closely monitor the situation, analyzing the risk, and helping everyone in need. For the past two days - 21-21th of May, water levels were decreasing,&nbsp; which indicates that the peak of the flood wave is behind us. This course of action is certainly a relief, as the new flood wave in these circumstances, will not erupt in the eastern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which puts out of danger more than 10000 inhabitants of the eastern part of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While causing enormous damage to almost 900 households, floods caused landslides, and road damage, which are long-term dangers for inhabitants of these municipalities. In the municipality of Bosanska Krupa, more than 230 households were affected, in Bihać 200, and in Novi Grad almost 30 people were displaced, while over 160 households were damaged. Floods caused tremendous damage to crops and farms - just in Kostajnica more than 450 hectares.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Volunteers and staff of the Red Cross organization were constantly on the field, assisting local authorities and other actors in fighting the floods, and helping everyone in need. Some of the most needed equipment - boots and raincoats; were provided by the Red Cross organization, while volunteers distributed food and hygiene items. The Emergency Operations Center of the Red Cross Society of Bosnia and Herzegovina was constantly working on gathering information about the situation and needs of endangered people, planning and implementing the humanitarian response. Information and data collected by the Red Cross organization were used by official institutions of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which showed the true potential of the Red Cross organization in all segments of response to disasters.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Red Cross organization maintained on the field even after the peak of the flood wave, gathering information about damage and needs of the affected people. Flood waves destroyed much of the healthy environment, spreading the dangers of infection and diseases. Many affected inhabitants lose their crops, farms, or other object needed for their survival, and help provided by the Red Cross organization is their only hope. In the next period, official authorities will form commissions to provide help to affected municipalities. In the meantime, the Red Cross organization remains a permanent partner and is sure to help everyone in need.</p>",

In total 10 cities/municipalities were affected in two Cantons (Tuzla Canton & Zenica-Doboj Canton). In two municipalities (Tešanj - Zenica-Doboj Canton and Čelić - Tuzla Canton) local authorities declared a state of natural disaster. As well landslides are identified at 8 locations. \n\nRCSBiH is currently out of DM Coordinator and all activities are managed by the Coordinator at the RCFBiH. The most endangered area is the Municipality of Čelić in Tuzla Canton. Staff and volunteers from the Red Cross of the Municipality of Čelić and the Red Cross of Tuzla Canton are on the ground every day providing support to the local community. Also part of the Protection and Rescue Service of the Red Cross of the Federation of BiH together with the Secretary General were on the spot on Sunday, June 12, 2022 and provided support (boots, shovels, water, trolley/carts, hygiene packs and etc).\n\nAccording to data from the field, about 400 houses were flooded, including the office and warehouse of the Red Cross of the municipality of Celic and is currently not operational (electronic devices were destroyed, computer, furniture, etc.). About 1,200 inhabitants are directly endangered by floods in this area.\n\nOne of the challenges faced by the citizens is the interruption in the water supply and the unavailability of drinking water, but also water to clean the facilities from sludge.\n\nTaking into account the importance of agricultural property in the Municipality of Celic and the fact that it is a source of income and survival for most residents, the destruction of a large number of greenhouses and crops has created additional challenges but also the need for help. \n\nThe most needed support (that can not be fully covered by local Red Cross) is in:\n• providing a larger number of dehumidifiers (inquiries and needs are constant from citizens and the local community)\n• material for disinfection and kits for cleaning the area from sludge (cloths, brushes, mop, buckets and etc)\n• greenhouses and seed products\n• cash intervention for the population\n• Reconstruction and equipping of the Red Cross office of the Municipality of Čelić\n",

            "description": "During the night of 5 November, central, eastern and southern parts of the country were hit by flash floods caused by intensive rainfall. Rivers Zeljeznica, Miljacka, Bosna and Neretva, together with smaller rivers which flow into them, flooded the area, causing damages and prompting evacuations. There are currently 18 affected municipalities in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in the Republic of Srpska. Affected municipalities are: Ilidza, Trnovo, East Ilidza, Trnovo (FBIH), Stari Grad, Konjic, Jablanica, Novi Grad, Kiseljak, Goražde, Pale (FBIH), Pale, Foča, Sokolac, Gacko, Foča (FBIH) and Novo Sarajevo. Another 5 municipalities were less affected. Landslides are recorded in different areas around the country. Wider area of Sarajevo remained without drinking water for up to three days, making the total number of affected people around 250 00 people. \n\nIn Ilidza, evacuation was needed at a home for elderly care, where over 58 people were evacuated to firefighting homesfire station   as a temporary solution. Livestock was evacuated as well, where possible. After the first night, they all decided to stay with family and friends, even though accommodation was offered by the Red Cross and authorities. Lower floors of an additional(?) home for elderly care were flooded, prompting evacuation of the residents to the upper floors. 55 residents of the home for elderly care eventually need to be accommodated, since accommodation in the affected facility is no longer possible. Since then, residents were re-allocated to other care home or family members. Residents were in need of Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS). People, who were evacuated to the firefighting home, are now staying at family members or at other locations. 106 housing buildings were flooded or damaged. The actions made in coordination of different actors, in activities to mitigate risks, have given results and no further damages were made. A total of 192 HHs were directly affected. \n\nIn Novi Grad, 80 people were evacuated from housing and industrial objects. 22 housing buildings are damaged. The only company that produces medical oxygen in the country is located in this municipality and their facility was in danger with the rising waters, prompting evacuation of parts of equipment and staff to a different location. After the initial flooding, on the second day, water levels have been decreasing. A total number of directly affected HHs is 71.\n\nIn Municipality Trnovo (FBIH), 20 housing buildings are damaged, together with many roads. In Vogošća municipality 20 housing objects were damaged. \n\nImage 4. Flooded houses in Trnovo, Red Cross of Republic of Srpsk photo: RCSBiH  \n\nIn Trnovo, 118 housing buildings were damaged. The livelihoods of people are damaged or destroyed, since the agricultural land is flooded, and more than 100 livestock drowned during the flooding of the river Zeljeznica. During the weekend   of 6-7 November, flooding brought much material with the water, which decreases the capacity of the riverbed to take additional quantities of water, increasing the risk of further damages. Eventually, the situation resolved with minimum additional damages. In the immediate aftermath of the rainfall, landslides started which initiated further Image 4. Flooded houses in Trnovo, Red Cross of Republic of Srpsk photo: RCSBiH   initiated further damage to housing objects. Livelihoods are also damaged. \n\n\nIn Konjic, 20 residences of a Hotovlje local community were evacuated to the local mosque, and there are no available roads to approach them. This blockage is caused by heavy landslides, which started as a result of the rainfall. Civil protection teams are working on the field to find a solution trying to fix the connecting roads, while going on foot to provide assistance to the population. A power generator was delivered to the village, so the residents have electricity until the road is fixed. Most of the population is elderly. Many housing objects around the municipality are damaged. Another 5 housing objects are damaged by the landslides. \n\nIn Jablanica, Gacko and Foča, landslides started as a result of rainfall, also damaging the livelihoods. In these municipalities, a total of 19 HHs were directly affected. Damages to livelihoods were recorded in Pale municipality, due to landslides and flash floods. A total of 180 HHs were directly affected.  In Sokolac, the storm weather created damages to 6 HHs. In the municipality of Stari Grad in Sarajevo, there was no drinking water for two days straight, while electricity blackouts were recorded in several municipalities.                                                                                         \n\n\nIn other municipalities, damages on the infrastructure were recorded. \nIn most areas, population and authorities are calling for support in the form of equipment for cleaning the housing objects. \n\nThe HQs of the Red Cross Society of BiH suffered damage from the intensive rainfall. The damage was amplified since the incident happened while renovation works were ongoing. The HQs space is still not available for work on a permanent basis. Red Cross of Federation of BiH HQs stayed without electricity, forcing the DM team to work at a displaced location. \n\nOn November 5, the state of emergency had been declared in Republic of Srpska and in municipalities of Ilidza, Novi Grad, Konjic, Zivinice, Vogosca, Trnovo (FBIH) in Federation of BiH.",
