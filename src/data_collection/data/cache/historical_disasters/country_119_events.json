According to the US Geological Survey (USGS), the quake originated at a depth of18.5km below the surface. Its epicentre was identified in the High Atlas Mountains, located 71km south-west of the city of Marrakesh, a major economic center.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">The earthquake was felt as far away as Portugal and Algeria, according to the Portuguese Institute for Sea and Atmosphere and Algeria’s Civil Defence agency. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported that a magnitude-4.9 aftershock hit 19 minutes later. The earthquake's aftershocks instilled fear among the survivors, forcing many to sleep in the streets. According to Reuters, the continued risk of landslides and the large distances involved complicated the rescue and relief efforts.The remote villages nestled in the High Atlas Mountains, right at the earthquake's epicentre, suffered substantial losses. Due to the blocked roads and the challenging terrain, emergency services faced difficulties in reaching the wounded.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">Remote villages high in the Atlas Mountains, near the earthquake's epicenter, suffered substantial damage. The Moroccan search and rescue teams, with the support of teams from Spain, Britain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates stepped up a massive effort to bring relief to devastated mountain villages. This earthquake was the deadliest in Morocco since 2004. According to the national authorities, 2,946 people died while the amount of injured reached 5,674. It is estimated that 59,674 houses were destroyed or damaged. According to the ministry, 1,404 of the injured were in critical condition.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">Geographic priorities are hard to reach areas in:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">Haouz Province</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">Taroudant Province</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">Marrakech-Safi Region</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">Chichaoua Province</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">Sectoral Needs:</span></strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">Food Security and Livelihoods:</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"> 3.5 months post-earthquake, the market supply has returned to normal, but elevated prices persist due to the country's inflation, mirroring global economic trends. While some camp sites continue to receive food assistance from various organizations and the Government, those residing in remote mountain areas confront food shortages. On one hand, the initial wave of  solidarity  has dwindled, and on the other, families lack the means to purchase essential supplies. In these remote regions, families heavily rely on remittances sent by individuals (men) who had migrated to urban areas for employment. The earthquake prompted their return, jeopardizing their jobs, and they are hesitant to go back to the cities until their families are relocated to more secure shelters or their homes are rebuilt. They're going to stay until the breaking point, they said in Ighermane-Chichaoua Province.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">Agricultural activities have resumed but farmers unusual weather patterns, such as delayed rains with no precipitation in mid-December (compared to the usual mid-November onset), this will disrupt the farming cycle. Compounding this issue is the inability to replace deceased animals due to challenges in providing adequate shelter, limited space near tent sites, and insufficient fodder.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">At present, priority for families is to stockpile food as the winter peak approaches (January/February).

As a result, securing sufficient provisions before winter sets in is crucial for their sustenance and survival.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">Health:</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"> Post-earthquake health care has improved, with emergency treatments provided for various ailments and PTSD.

Over 530 schools were damaged, placing approximately 100,000 children at elevated protection risk. While temporary tent classrooms provide a short-term solution, halted education exposes children to potential exploitation. Vulnerable groups, including children, women, the elderly, and marginalized individuals, face intensified vulnerabilities and require specialized protection, support, and safety measures.

Traditional mud houses suffered the most, rendering many homeless, adding to a total of 59k houses damaged and 19k destroyed. Mountainous areas, particularly in Tinmel and Ouarzazate, urgently require tents, blankets, and warm clothing, underscoring the need for timely and equitable aid distribution.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin: 0in; font-size: medium; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\">WASH:</span></strong><span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;\"> Following the earthquake, most mountains areas within the districts of El Houz, Chichaoua and Taroudant faced significant water disruptions, waternetwork and watertanks being broken by falling rocks. During first weeks, irrigation canals were used to provide low quality drinking water. Open air defacation  was the solution used for sanitation.

Demand for quality and quantity improveent of clear water, sanitation facilities and hygiene promotion is still high in most of the areas, particularly the most remoted valleys. </span></p>",
