Weather forecast warns from severe weather conditions all over the country, and mainly in the northern part of the country, the northern coastal plain, the mountains in the central part of the country, and Jerusalem.\nDuring the night, storm Elpis has brought down snow on the Golan Heights and is expected to spread to the Galilee mountains, and later today to the mountains in the center of the country, including Jerusalem. Up to 20 cm of snow is expected to pile in regions higher than 700 meters. It will stop snowing tomorrow morning, and the snow will melt slowly.\nWind gusts of 60-80 km/h are possible, with 5-7 meters high waves in the Mediterranean Coastline.\nThe rain started dropping on Wednesday morning in the north of the country and will last until Saturday, spreading from north to northern Negev (covering most of the populated regions of the country). Flash floods are predicted in the northern coastal plain.\nTemperatures will be relatively cold, ranging from 2 to 5 C at night to 4 to 8 C during the day, in the colder places in Israel.",
