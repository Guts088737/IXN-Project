            "description": "<p>To determine the scope and scale of this event, secondary information from national government bodies and their official assessments&nbsp;has been used, alongside data from the PRC's initial needs assessment through triangulation. It is important to note that this assessment&nbsp;is preliminary and does not reflect the full extent of the damage or impact. Ongoing assessments will provide additional information, and this report will be updated accordingly.<br>According to the National Emergency and Civil Protection Authority, more than 37,772 personnel have been involved in the response to&nbsp;the fire emergency, supported by 10,639 ground resources and over 827 aerial missions. The European Civil Protection Mechanism also&nbsp;deployed eight additional aircraft to assist firefighting efforts, which are working alongside local resources to contain the most severe outbreaks. International support has also included technical, financial, and material assistance.</p>\n<p>Considering that the affected areas were declared to be in a state of calamity (the declaration of the government doesn't state a list of&nbsp;municipalities or districts), it is estimated that at least 10% of the total population in these councils had their daily lives impacted by the&nbsp;disaster. This corresponds to approximately 41,329 people in total. Additionally, as reported by ANEPC, five people have died as a result&nbsp;of the fires, and 161 people have been injured, 12 critically. In response to the tragic loss of life, the government declared 20 September a&nbsp;Day of National Mourning to honor the victims.</p>\n<p>The initial needs assessment conducted by the PRC identifies that the main needs of the affected populations are related to&nbsp;accommodation, hygiene kits, drinking water, psychosocial support, food support and financial support. Furthermore, authorities&nbsp;reported that thousands were indirectly affected due to destroyed infrastructure, power outages, and road closures, which prevented&nbsp;access to workplaces.</p>\n<p>The most vulnerable populations are in rural areas of Aveiro, Viseu, Coimbra, Braga, Porto and Castelo Branco, where the fires forced&nbsp;evacuations, destroyed homes, and disrupted livelihoods. The economic consequences are particularly severe in agriculture and forestry dependent areas, where decreased productivity is expected to increase economic vulnerability among affected families. Major road&nbsp;closures for at least two days further disrupted daily routines, with many residents unable to work and several companies forced to&nbsp;adjust or cancel services. Beyond material losses, the psychological toll is significant, with many requiring psychosocial support due to the&nbsp;trauma and imminent danger caused by the fires.</p>",

Since then, seismic activity on the island has registered a significant increase and remains above reference values. Since the beginning of the crisis, there have been more than 20.000 earthquake of which 215 were noticed by population.\n\nOn March 23rd, the Azores Regional Government increased the Volcanic Alert Level to V4 (danger on volcanic cone, caldera and all island, possibility of very large eruption and also chance of flank eruption / hazardous eruption is possible within days).\n\nA 3.8-magnitude (Richter Scale) tremor struck 2 kilometers south from Velas in Ocean last March 29th\n\nThe total number or tremors have been reducing last days, but specialists say the risk analyses hasn´t changed.\n\nThis fissure system, which coincides with the main volcanic cones of the island, is still active and has now recorded a release of energy that is unusual in recent years.",
