            "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Adverse Weather Alert - Yellow Level and Riverine Flood Alert - Orange Level (Caroni River) remain in effect for Trinidad until 6:00pm this afternoon (Friday 13<sup>th</sup> June 2025). The TTRCS conducted community site visits yesterday to determine the severity of the flooding in high risk and impacted communities.&nbsp;In many areas, the Caroni River continues to exceed capacity near the Tumpuna and El Carmen areas, and overspilling is ongoing. Water levels<br>remain dangerously high and forecast rainfall is expected to exacerbate current conditions. The Manuel Congo River, after an earlier decline, is now gradually rising again due to yesterday&rsquo;s rainfall and is nearing critical levels once more. The South Oropouche River is also at threatening levels and continues a slow but steady rise. Some areas along this river have already experienced localized overflows, posing increased risk to surrounding communities. Further rainfall will likely worsen riverine flooding conditions. As a result, a severe risk remains to public safety, livelihoods, and property, particularly for residents in flood-prone communities along the Caroni, Manuel Congo and South Oropouche Rivers. <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span>Other rivers, including the North Oropouche, are rising at lower rates but are<br>still under close observation.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Based on the latest report from the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management, a total of 81 official reports were received which included 16 reports of street flooding, 40 reports of residential flooding, 3 damaged roofs, 12 landslides and 10 fallen trees. While the number of residential flooding is low in this report, visual observation yesterday by the TTRCS team estimates 80-100 households were directly affected with floods, where water was observed in persons homes in the areas assessed.</p>",

The effects on the communities in proximity to where the river has over topped is not clear at this time as no official report from state authorities has been published or shared internally with response agencies.

Rains began falling across Trinidad on the eastern coast arond noon and the system quickly made its way across Trinidad within a couple of hours. Intense rainfall was concentrated in the northern part of the island while most of the country experienced some amount of rainfall. From 2pm initial reports came in of water levels rising in rivers in the major watercourses in Diego Martin and San Juan/Laventille and flash flooding occuring in typical places across both regions. By 3pm several watercourses began overtopping and flooding nearby street and communties. The Ministry of Rural Development at Local Government began posting notices of flooded areas and warning to avoid areas. Within the Diego Martin area the communties Carenage, Blue Basin, Morne Coco Road, Saddle Road, Maraval and Petit Valley were among the communties affected with street and flashflooding and very localized riverine flooding. A major landslide was reported on the Northcoast Road which leads to popular beaches stranding motorists on either side, and smaller landslides in hilly areas around St. James. As of this time the TTRCS does not have confirmed reports of the possible number of households affected and the extent to flooded communities.&nbsp;</p>",

Localized ponding in low lying areas and overtopping of some smaller tributaries are causing roadways to have several feet of water in some areas up to four feet of water. These communities are very rural and not all homes are affected. Because of perennial flooding, many homes have adapted by building on posts. The extent of the damage is not yet determined as access is only limited to high vehicles at this time. In the northern part of Trinidad today a brief, but intense shower did cause some localized flash flooding in northwest communities of Diego Martin, Maraval and Port of Spain, however this quickly subsided. TTRCS will continue to monitor the situation to determine any need for support.&nbsp;</p>",

As of 5 am, Hurricane Beryl was located near 11.7&deg;N 59.9&deg;W, approximately 93km northeast of Tobago, moving west near 31 km/h. Periods of showers and gusty winds have been observed and further deterioration is expected with gusts in excess of 70km/h. There is a high chance (90%) of hazardous seas with large, battering waves. Mariners should expect wave heights to increase significantly, posing a danger to small craft, coastal and offshore activities. Strong currents and choppy seas will make navigation hazardous (excerpt from Met Bulletin)</p>\n<p>Hurricane Beryl is still impacting the Trinidad and Tobago even as the eye as passed north of Tobago. From 6am more intense weather was experienced along the north coastlines of Tobago and the northeast side of Trinidad. Tobago did experience heavy rains and wind with caused serval tress to fall in at least six communities, 27 Tobago communties are without power and as of 9am 128 people are in 14 emergency shelters across Tobago. For Trinidad the damage has been minimal, there have been some fallen trees, and power outages in six communities mainly along the northcoast area.

Currently Tobago is under Hurricane Warning and Trinidad under Tropical Strom Watch. Beryl is expected to pass between Tobago and Barbados with adverse weather beginning from as early as 8pm on June 30th into the morning. Intense wind and rain associated with Beryl will affect Tobago more than Trinidad especially the northeastern communities of Charlottesville, and Speyside together with interior communities that suffer from landslide risk.  For Trinidad, tropical storm conditions are forecasted with less intense rainfall and winds, however we have been experiencing persistent rainfall for the last three days which have made soils saturated and rivers unable to fully run off. The additional rains will likely cause flash flooding in typical areas such as Port of Spain, and Tunapuna/Piarco. Coastal communities in the east such as Mayaro/Rio Claro could face challenges with storm surge, and north coast communities from Toco to Matelot typically suffer from fallen trees and landslides which can isolate them. Southern communities of Woodland, Penal/Debe would experience riverine floods.",

            "description": "<p>On Wednesday 7th February 2024, at 7am reports were recieved by the Tobago Emergency Management Agency (TEMA) of the appareance of an oil-like substance washing onshore at Canoe Bay which is a remote part of the Tobago Shoreline just off the Cove Eco-Industrial Estate. That day officials of the Tobago House of Assembly (THA) and TEMA hosted a media conference indicating that an unidentified vessel had overturned about 200 meters from the costline and was eminating and oil-like substance which began to wash ashore. The THA mobilized assets and divers from its Maritime Services Unit to 1. Identify the vessel and 2. Determine if any souls were on board, the results were inconclusive as divers could not get a good view in the murky waters. However a diver was able to make out the marking \"Gulfstream\" on the vessel however they were not able to find the IMO vessel identifier therefore to today the vessel is still unidentified. There were no evidence that persons were onboard the vessel. In the past few days coastal clean up has been ongoing. The THA Chief Secretary and TEMA have been calling the incident a Tier 2 diaster where all national resources would be needed. Today there were reports that international assistance may be needed to help contain the situation, which would automatically make the incident an official disaster at level 3. In past major oil spill situation international assistance was needed so this is not new to have international technical assistance mobilized to support.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A GIS representation of the affected area was done by TEMA and can be accessed here: https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=791943569640726&amp;set=pcb.791943722974044 As the area of the overtunred vessel is solely industrial the only impact is to the environment there is not community near by. The area where the oil is coming onshore is not a tourist site not a fishing port. There may be long term damage to the coral reef at Canoe Bay which may have knock on effects with fishing areas in the vicinity. Assessments for this has not been started.</p>",

That day officials of the Tobago House of Assembly (THA) and TEMA hosted a media conference indicating that an unidentified vessel had overturned about 200 meters from the costline and was eminating and oil-like substance which began to wash ashore. The THA mobilized assets and divers from its Maritime Services Unit to 1. Identify the vessel and 2. Determine if any souls were on board, the results were inconclusive as divers could not get a good view in the murky waters. However a diver was able to make out the marking \"Gulfstream\" on the vessel however they were not able to find the IMO vessel identifier therefore to today the vessel is still unidentified. There were no evidence that persons were onboard the vessel. In the past few days coastal clean up has been ongoing. The THA Chief Secretary and TEMA have been calling the incident a Tier 2 diaster where all national resources would be needed. Today there were reports that international assistance may be needed to help contain the situation, which would automatically make the incident an official disaster at level 3. In past major oil spill situation international assistance was needed so this is not new to have international technical assistance mobilized to support.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A GIS representation of the affected area was done by TEMA and can be accessed here: https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=791943569640726&amp;set=pcb.791943722974044 As the area of the overtunred vessel is solely industrial the only impact is to the environment there is not community near by. The area where the oil is coming onshore is not a tourist site not a fishing port. There may be long term damage to the coral reef at Canoe Bay which may have knock on effects with fishing areas in the vicinity. Assessments for this has not been started.</p>",

Over the last two weeks the TTRCS has mobilized fully, to bring relief to the affected population as well as begin assessments to determine the longer-term needs. During the first few days it was difficult to access communities as water levels were very high and it required specialized vehicles or boats in many instances to access the community when the TTRCS had to deliver meals. Many persons disregarded warnings to evacuate for fears of leaving their homes and possessions to criminal elements, and were trapped when water levels reached very high. Several homes also had elderly persons who had difficulty moving and felt comfortable in their homes who needed to be rescued as the water began entering their properties. By Friday 2nd December, water has receded in the majority of communities and response went into full gear to supported the affected. The TTRCS mobilized in coordination with the Office of Disaster Preparedness and Management (ODPM) and the Local Government Authorities - Disaster Management Units to bring relief with the resources we had in stock.&nbsp;</p>",

With current weather patterns creating constant rainfall all communties are still heavily impacted with water as it is taking longer than expected for water to run off especially since tides are higher than usual. There are five severly impacted regions in Trinidad, Sangre Grande, Tunapuna/Piarco, Mayaro/Rio Claro, San Juan Laventille, and Penal/Debe. All of these areas (except San Juan Laventille) are experiencing over four to six feet of water and since Sunday the water levels are rising higher, especially in the western communties where the Caroni River traverses. This phenomenon is related to the movement of water from higher areas to the coastlines. The TTRCS is currently mobilizing to provide immediate relief in coordination with the national disaster office with hot meals and water to the affected areas which are marooned since Sunday. Several Shelters are open to accomodate persons who wish to evacuate, however only approximately 40 persons are in shelters. The TTRCS would have provided 250 blankets to the Ministry of Rural Development and Local Government to mobilize to shelters across Trinidad at the start of the wet season. Only when water levels subside the TTRCS will mobilize to conduct assessments at a household level.&nbsp;</p>",

For several days Trinidad and Tobago have been experiencing significant amounts of rainfall due to the passage of several tropical waves back to back. Water courses across the country are not getting an opportunity to drain out to sea due the amount of rainfall. Our major river, the Caroni River has been at threshold levels for some days. On Thursday afternoon there were reports that at one point along the Caroni River, farmers cut the embankment for access to water for farms and at this point, the river began to overtop its banks and was slowly flooding some streets within the Caroni community which was located approximately 1000 feet from the river bank. At 9pm approximately six residents in the area reported flood waters entering their property and homes. The Municipality deployed a vehicle with three small water pumps, which were not able to displace enough water. Around 2am on Friday 5th August, the Ministry of Work deployed a trailer mounter 12\" pump which was able to slow the water from entering further in to the community, until more rains began to fall during the early morning hours. At 10pm we received media reports of several streets in Caroni being flooded with 6-8 inches of water as well as some homes having about 1 foot of water. Reports from the Disaster Management Unit indicate that there are about 30 possible homes that may have been affected, but detailed assessments are still underway. The Met Office has since discontinued the Riverine Flood Alert as waters begin to recede from all areas.  ",
