        "summary": "Dengue is considered the most rapidly spreading mosquito-borne disease worldwide (WHO, 2009). In Sri Lanka, the first reported cases appeared in 1965, and the disease quickly escalated into an island-wide epidemic. Between 1965 and 1968, with 51 suspected cases and 15 deaths were reported. From 1969 to 1988, several similar outbreaks occurred, predominantly in urban areas, although case reporting during this period was sporadic.\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>According to the Weekly Epidemiological Report (Sri Lanka, 2008), dengue became a recurring public health issue with increasing frequency and severity beginning in 1989. Significant outbreaks were recorded in the early 2000s, notably in 2002 and 2004, with 8,931 and 15,463 reported cases,<br>respectively. The most severe outbreak occurred in 2017, with 186,101 cases and a case fatality rate of 0.24%. Based on data from the National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU), this remains the highest number of reported cases in the past decade.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>A notable surge occurred in 2019, with cases doubling from 51,659 in 2018 to 105,049, with an increase in deaths. During the COVID-19 pandemic period (2020–2021), dengue cases remained relatively controlled. In 2022, the number of reported cases rose to 76,689, although this figure remained below the 2019 peak. According to the National Dengue Control Unit (NDCU), 89,799 suspected dengue cases were reported in 2023, marking a significant increase compared to 2022.</div>\r\n<div> </div>\r\n<div>Dengue prevention requires coordinated efforts from the government, private sector, and communities. In Sri Lanka, the government and public health authorities have implemented various measures to control and prevent dengue outbreaks. The Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS) successfully implemented two DREF operations (MDRLK007 in 2017 and MDRLK017 in 2023) in response to dengue outbreaks. These interventions contributed significantly to controlling the spread of the disease. Notably, the early launch of the 2023 operation helped prevent the number of cases from reaching the epidemic levels seen in 2017, highlighting the importance and effectiveness of early action.</div>\r\n<div> </div>",

            "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">With the intensification of the southwest monsoon, Sri Lanka has experienced heavy rainfall in Western, Sabaragamuwa, provinces and in Galle and Matara districts, which are the most affected areas. Indeed, the heavy rains, high winds, and floods due to the water levels of the Nilwala Gin Kalu and athtnagalu oya Rivers have risen to alarming levels. In the Matara and Gampaha districts, according to the Disaster Management Center (DMC), most damages were reported. total of thirty-two Divisional Secretary divisions are severely affected. As a result of the continued heavy rains and strong winds (over 70 km/h) houses have been damaged and trees have fallen, blocking the main access to several districts. In addition, due to the severity of the situation, agricultural lands and standing crops have been damaged in low-lying areas of the districts of Galle and Matara caused by flooding, while houses, common buildings, and markets are inundated. Due to the increase in the water level of the main rivers, the small and medium-scale bridges, and culverts have gone under the water, cutting off access roads at several places where people were stranded or forced to wait until the water receded. The DMC also reported that many schools have been flooded due to the heavy rainfall in those areas since 19<sup>th</sup> September and that students have lost their school materials/stationery during the flooding that affected their houses.

Indeed, the heavy rains, high winds, and floods due to the water levels of the Nilwala Gin Kalu and athtnagalu oya Rivers have risen to alarming levels. In the Matara and Gampaha districts, according to the Disaster Management Center (DMC), most damages were reported. total of thirty-two Divisional Secretary divisions are severely affected. As a result of the continued heavy rains and strong winds (over 70 km/h) houses have been damaged and trees have fallen, blocking the main access to several districts. In addition, due to the severity of the situation, agricultural lands and standing crops have been damaged in low-lying areas of the districts of Galle and Matara caused by flooding, while houses, common buildings, and markets are inundated. Due to the increase in the water level of the main rivers, the small and medium-scale bridges, and culverts have gone under the water, cutting off access roads at several places where people were stranded or forced to wait until the water receded. The DMC also reported that many schools have been flooded due to the heavy rainfall in those areas since 19<sup>th</sup> September and that students have lost their school materials/stationery during the flooding that affected their houses. Schools in several educational zones in the Matara district schools were temporarily closed on the 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> of October due to unfavorable weather conditions.

Based on previous movements and established routes, it is assumed that the intended destination was either Malaysia or Indonesia. According to UNHCR, a boat carrying 105 people was rescued by the Sri Lanka Navy in Trincomalee harbour on the country's eastern coast, on 18 December and disembarked on 20 December. When the boat ran into engine trouble in rough seas, it was suspected that it was on its way to Indonesia. The Sri Lanka Navy first detected the boat when it was 3.5 nautical miles (6.5km) from the shore. After the legal proceedings, they were transferred to Jaffna Prison in the country's north. According to Sri Lanka's immigration officials, the arrivals were transferred to an immigration detention camp in the Colombo suburbs on 22 December 2022.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: normal; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;\"><span style=\"color: #212121; font-family: OpenSans; font-size: 10pt;\">Following a field assessment by the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society (SLRCS)/International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) team, it has been confirmed that the Sri Lanka Navy has received 105 displaced people from Rakhine, Myanmar, including 49 children (21 girls, 28 boys) and 56 adults (26 females, 30 males). Furthermore, 21 unaccompanied children (8 boys, 13 girls) and 1 elderly person (68 years) were identified among the arrivals, but no person with disability (PWD) was identified. Due to their deteriorating health, three of the arrivals (2 children, 1 woman) are admitted to the hospital. The language barrier has been identified as the most significant barrier to communicating with the displaced people in order to comprehend the situation.</span></p>",

Due to the severity of the situation, agricultural lands and standing crops were also damaged <span style=\"letter-spacing: -.4pt;\">in low lying areas due to flooding </span>while infrastructure and housing damages have also been reported. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\">According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) situation report, as of 8 August 2022, over 15,000 people (4,000 families)havebeenaffectedacrosstendistricts.Further, several landslides, rock falls, and collapse of retaining walls have been reported in the Nuwara Eliya and Kandy districts blocking the rail line and main roads at several places. A number of houses were affected due to flooding in Nuwara Eliya district. Flooding was also reported in the Rathnapura district, cutting off access roads at several places where people were stranded or had to wait until water levels recede. The DMC is coordinating the national response efforts.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoBodyText\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\">Due to heavy rain, the existing water and sanitation facilities in the communities are affected and inundated, including the sewerage lines. Due to the impact of landslides, people living in low-lying areas have also lost their basic amenities at the household level. Initial reports from DMC and Divisional Secretariats reveal that there is a need for essential household items and there are challenges as transportation of goods to affected areas is disrupted due to road blockages as well as fuel shortages. In addition, households will require support to cover their immediate basic needs as the local employment opportunities have been reduced due to continuous rain and exacerbated by the current <strong>economic crisis</strong> that is continuously affecting the households’ economic condition. Overflow of water from several major dams in the central hills was reported, threatening downstream communities with the risk of flooding. The Department of irrigation has been monitoring the situation and as the heavy rains stopped on 8 August, currently there is no risk of downstream flooding.</span></p>",

        "summary": "<h4>Summary<br /><br /></h4>\r\n<span style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;\">An economic crisis and a ban on synthetic fertiliser in Sri Lanka, which has been developing since <strong>March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic</strong>, has sparked<strong> civil unrest and food insecurity</strong>. To save its foreign currency reserves, the Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) limited the import of essential items.<br /><br /></span>In the first quarter of 2022, GoSL was unable to import the required quantity of petroleum products such as diesel, petrol, coal, and other hydrocarbons used in thermal power plants. This resulted in long power cuts (even 13 hours a day), long queues at fuel and cooking gas stations for days and disrupted schedules for public transport services. <br /><br />Since the GoSL decided to limit the import of nonorganic fertiliser in January 2022, homegrown agricultural product inflation increased to 24.7 per cent in February 2022, due to production shortages. By April 2022, food inflation in the country increased to 45.1 per cent from 29.5 per cent in March 2022. The shortages in food, fuel, and medicine turned months of peaceful protests into violence which killed 10 people and injured more than 250 by May 2022. <br /><br />Sri Lanka’s president declared a state of emergency on 6 May 2022, the second time in a span of five weeks. Protests have continued to take place sporadically, also after a new prime minister was appointed on 12 May 2022 to lead the government.<br /><br />Severe food shortages are expected in the coming months as food production dropped approximately 50 per cent during the last season (Maha cultivation season September 2021- March 2022) and more than 50 per cent of commercial farmers have stopped cultivation in the current season (Yala season, May-August 2022) due to non-availability of fertiliser and fuel to operate their equipment. According to a World Food Programme (WFP) rapid assessment, an estimated 38 per cent of people are already facing moderate to severe food insecurity.<br /><br />Over a third of households in urban and rural areas are applying emergency coping strategies, such as withdrawing children from school, migrating to other areas in search of employment and selling houses or land. The lack of fuel has affected the income of staff employed in the transportation sector as well as the capacity of fishing communities, for example, to operate their fishing boats which they depend on for sustenance. <br /><br />The suspension of routine surgeries was reported in four major hospitals due to a shortage of medical supplies, medicines, and 10-13 hours-long power cuts.<br /><br />\r\n<h3>Key humanitarian impacts due to the ongoing crisis:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Civil unrest and violence resulting in injuries, hospitalisations, property damage and arrests.</li>\r\n<li>Loss of livelihoods, particularly by urban and rural daily wage earners, who consequently face food insecurity due to the sudden loss in income and high price increases of essential food and household items; by fishing communities which do not have fuel to operate their fishing boats; and farmers who lack fertilisers and are hit by sharp price increases in agricultural inputs.</li>\r\n<li>A severe food insecurity crisis is looming across the country while certain food supplements for children and nursing mothers, such as milk powder, fresh milk and Thriposha (an additional food rich in nutrients) are not available.</li>\r\n<li>Children’s education is affected due to power cuts, inadequate public transport, and the lack of stationery items.</li>\r\n<li>Days spent in the hot sun and rain waiting in long queues without drinking water, food and sanitation is resulting in deaths and hospitalisations.</li>\r\n<li>The multiple challenges and increased burdens are having a detrimental effect on people’s mental well-being.</li>\r\n<li>The shortage of consumables in the country and sharp decline in agricultural production has resulted in rapid price increases in staple food items like rice and vegetables.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2><img src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/BndvTMYT/Sri-Lanka-Complex-Emergency.png\" alt=\"\" /></h2>\r\n<br /> <br />\r\n<h1><br /><br /><br /></h1>",

            "description": "The monsoon rainy season continued with low rainfall since the last update without significant impact. However, the intensity of the rainfall increased during the last two days which caused floods and landslides again in the same districts where the current DREF operation is ongoing, as well as three adjacent districts in the western and southwestern part of the country. Affected districts include; Colombo, Gampaha, Kaluthara, Rathnapura, Puttlam, and Nuwara Eliya. According to the metrological department, 331 mm rain reported in the Kalutara district.  \nAccording to the last update from the Disaster Management Centre(DMC) yesterday, three people died and two others are reported missing, while over 468 houses have been fully or partially damaged and 133280 people belonging to 31,990 families were affected. Since the rain is continuing currently, these figures may change in the coming days.  \nThe income sources of most vulnerable people have been affected due to floods and landslides and further exacerbated by the ongoing COVID19 lockdown in the country",

            "description": "The Singapore-registered X-Press Pearl had been on fire for almost two weeks before the blaze was put out last week. Hundreds of tonnes of oil from fuel tanks could leak into the sea, devastating nearby marine life. The Sri Lankan and Indian navies had worked jointly over the past days in an attempt to put out the fire and prevent the ship from breaking up and sinking. But rough seas and monsoonal winds hampered the operation, just outside the port of Colombo.\n•\tSri Lankan authorities have managed to contain the fire on board X-Press Pearl cargo ship off the west coast. The ship was carrying 1400 containers with nitric acid, sodium hydroxide, plastic pellets, microplastic, raw materials for cosmetics, and other dangerous substances when the fire broke out nearly two weeks ago while it was docked 14km from the Colombo port. Attempts to tow the ship from the shallow waters to deep-sea have been abandoned as the ship started sinking. \n•\tAuthorities are now preparing to face an oil spill as the ship had 278 tonnes of bunker fuel oil,  50 tonnes of gas oil, and 20 containers of lubricating oil. Oil spills can have potentially devastating impacts on the marine environment and livelihoods of the fishing community.  \n•\tThe plastic pellets and other materials from the ship have washed ashore spreading across 80 -100 Km of western coast including the southern coast carpeting beaches and posing a threat to marine life and humans.  According to Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), the cleaning up operation will be long and difficult given the scale of the spread and as Sri Lanka is under COVID19 lockdown. The general public is not allowed to come to the beaches due to the toxicity of the materials.  \n•\tClean-up operations and the fishing in the area have been hampered by the current southwest monsoon rains particularly in the three districts of the western province- Gampaha, Colombo, and Kaluthara.  \n•\tFish consumption has gone down considerably across Sri Lanka even in the areas outside the impact zone as people fear fish contamination with toxic substances, although fishing has only been banned around the areas of severe impact on the west coast.     \n",

        "summary": "<p>On 20 May 2021, cargo ship “X-PRESS PEARL with 1,486 containers onboard carrying dangerous cargo; 25 tonnes of nitric acid, caustic soda, solid sodium methoxide solution, cosmetics, methanol and vinyl acetate including microplastics, plastic pellets together with other cargo caught fire about nine nautical miles (16 km) off the coast of Colombo commercial shipping harbor. The fire continued to burn till the end of May and several small explosions were heard from the container ship during the fire. Sri Lanka Navy, Airforce, Coast Guard supported by the Indian Navy worked around the clock to contain the fire for nearly two weeks. The firefighting was made complicated by the southwest monsoon rains/ high winds and highly flammable poisonous cargo. The 25 crews of Indian, Philippines, Chinese and Russian nationals were evacuated and are currently being treated at hospitals in Colombo.</p>\r\n<p>According to Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA), this is Sri Lanka’s worst environmental disaster in its history with unimaginable consequences to the marine environment. The situation was brought under control by 1 June 2021 and the fire was contained, although thick smoke plumes were seen emitting from the ship as well as small explosions continued to be heard from the ship. The MEPA was able to go to the ship only after the fire was put out and could assess the situation. This is the time when they could share also the first preliminary assessment report, and the coordination could start with SLRCS.</p>\r\n<p>The fire caused spillage of damaged containers, microplastics, an estimated 3 billion tiny plastic pellets, chemicals and other harmful toxic substance into the sea. The flotsam was spread across vast areas on the western side of the coastline affecting the districts of Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara.</p>\r\n<p>Chemical spills and plastic pellets have caused massive damages to the coastline, natural marine environment and ecosystem including damages to several popular tourist areas and resorts. Beaches were thickly coated with plastic pellets; microplastics and some oil slicks were visible in the water. The plastic pallets used to make polythene bags and other plastic products have already caused fatal damages to marine life and a number of dead sea turtles, fish and birds were seen along the coastline. Local people were strictly advised not to touch any of the debris as it could be highly toxic and harmful to the human body.</p>\r\n<p>Fishing has been banned about 50 km stretch of the coastline mainly in Gampaha and Colombo districts and according to the Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, more than 16,500 fisher folks and their families living along the Western coastline have been affected. The fisheries sector of Sri Lanka consists three main sub sectors, namely coastal, offshore and deep sea. Coastal fishing community is the most vulnerable as they are daily income earners, and they are the ones severely affected by this disaster. Prior to this incident, the fishermen could not venture into the sea for two weeks as they were warned of an adverse monsoon weather conditions with heavy rains in the western coastal belt. The fisheries sector has already been affected due to the COVID-19 pandemic and this incident has further exacerbated the conditions of lives and livelihoods of fishing communities.</p>\r\n<p>Although some experts believe that some of the oil must have burnt with the fire, authorities however are preparing to face an oil spill as the ship had 278 tonnes of bunker fuel oil, 50 tonnes of gas oil and 20 containers of lubricating oil. Oil spills can have potentially devastating impacts to the marine environment and livelihoods of fishing community. MEPA has developed a contingency plan to deal with the potential oil spills and deployed assets and personnel to set up barriers around immediate vicinity of the ship, lagoon entrances as well as other identified locations along the beach. The extent of environmental damage is yet to be assessed in detail. However, experts believe that the ecological damage caused by this disaster is massive and unimaginable with long term negative consequences. NARA and MEPA are currently working on assessing the ecological damage.</p>",

            "description": "The Southwest monsoon and activation of depression over the southeast Arabian sea have been intensifying rainfall in Sri Lanka from 12th to 14th May 2021 where the Western/South and Sabaragamuawa provinces of Sri Lanka are worst affected. Sri Lanka’s Department of Meteorology has reported a maximum rainfall up to 336 millimeters in the Western province particularly in the Kalutara district. During this period four deaths have been reported in Gampaha, Colombo & Kegalle districts. \n\nEven though the rain has stopped still inundating most of the low-lying areas in the Nine districts and has caused damages to residential areas. As this situation is intensifying, agricultural lands and standing crops are also inundated and damaged as well as the infrastructures. Same time Sri Lanka Metrological department predicting the 18th to 22nd May heavy rainfall is going to continue again, which may escalate the impact and further exacerbate the capacity of vulnerable households in the affected areas. According to the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) situation report as of \n15 May 2021, 46,730 people (11,796 families) have been affected across 09 districts. According to the report, 03 houses are fully damaged, and 636 houses are partially damaged. A total of \n19 evacuation centres are activated and 304 families are located in these centres. The DMC \nis coordinating the national response efforts.\n\nDue to heavy rain, the existing water and sanitation facilities in the communities are affected and inundated, the sewerage lines are open to public water facilities and contaminated. People living in low-lying areas have also lost their basic amenities at the household level. Initial reports from DMC reveal that there is a need for drinking water, wells, and area cleaning since water sources have been contaminated. In addition, households will require support to cover their immediate basic needs as the local employment opportunities have been reduced due to continuous rain and the already existing COVID-19 pandemic that is affecting the households’ economic condition. Some water reservoirs are at spill level and there is the possibility of releasing water to reduce the flood threat to other areas.\n",
