The trigger statement indicates that the flood will be 20 years return flood, 7 days lead time, above 1000 HH and 100% threshold in the IBF and GloFAS. The early action activities will be implemented in 7 days. According to the system, there is a likelihood to experience floods in 10 districts across the country and potentially affecting a total of 100,264 people (16,712 Households). The IBF portal has pinpointed Kitwe district in the Copper Belt Province as likely to record the highest impact, estimated at 16,468 people, or 2,745 households.

Open defecation is being practiced and no lighting during the night  \n-More Districts recording floods including Kalomo (160 households) and currently in Ndola, 113 families displaced and evacuated to schools where hygiene and food are priority challenges",

On the 16th of January 2022, Kalomo, Namwala, and Choma districts of the Southern Province started experiencing flash floods. According to the needs assessment report issued by the Zambian government through Disaster Management and Mitigation Unit (DMMU) (17th January 2022), Namwala district has recorded the highest number of households affected with 3,219. The report also indicated that 8,000 Ha of field crops have been submerged by water, as well as houses and sanitation facilities. In addition, livestock such as chickens and goats have also been swept away. Currently, 500 households have been displaced in Namwala and being accommodated in schools and the immediate needs include safe and clean water, hygiene and sanitation, food, Non-Food Items, shelter, and protection.</span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"> </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%;\">A total of 4 communities in Namwala have been affected: Nakamboma, Mbeza, Chitongo and Mandondo. During the first days of the disaster, only 1 ward is accessible by road and the remaining 3 can only be accessed by air transport. DMMU is collaborating with Zambia Air Force (ZAF) to reach out to the affected population. This number is likely to rise due to the continuous rainfall that is being experienced in the district. According to the Zambia Meteorological Department flash flood monitor, which was issued on 19th January 2022, it is indicating that Namwala district will continue experiencing flash floods which is likely to worsen the situation.  </span></p>",
