More than 2,000 houses were either damaged or destroyed, while major roads and bridges were washed away, isolating dozens of communities.</p>\n<p data-start=\"902\" data-end=\"1591\">Approximately <strong data-start=\"916\" data-end=\"943\">76,600 to 85,600 people</strong> have been directly affected, including thousands who lost homes, access to clean water, food sources, and means of livelihood. In Nghệ An alone, over <strong data-start=\"1094\" data-end=\"1111\">58,000 people</strong> across 132 villages in 15 communes have been cut off due to road blockages and rising river levels. In Điện Bi&ecirc;n and Sơn La, many families were forced to evacuate or take shelter in temporary locations as flash floods inundated homes and farmland. Livelihoods have been heavily disrupted, with thousands of hectares of rice, crops, and livestock lost. Immediate humanitarian needs include shelter, food, safe water, and access to healthcare for displaced and isolated households.</p>",

            "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">In recent days, severe weather caused by the circulation of Typhoon No. 3 has brought heavy rainfall and flash flooding across several northern and central provinces of Vietnam, including Nghe An, Son La, Dien Bien, and Quang Tri.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">According to VTV Times reporters, on the morning of July 24, four new flooding points were recorded along National Highway 7, passing through Nhan Hoa and Vinh Tuong communes (former Anh Son district, Nghe An province).</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\"><br>Water levels at these locations ranged from 50cm to nearly 1 meter, with strong currents, making it impossible for small vehicles to pass. Many residents were forced to turn back or take longer detours, disrupting daily activities and the transportation of goods.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">In particular, the section of National Highway 7 running through Cam Thang hamlet in Nhan Hoa commune was submerged under 50cm to 1m of water. Previously, the highway had been completely cut off due to floodwaters rising from the Lam River and local streams. Although the rain has eased, water levels in many areas have yet to recede.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Authorities are closely monitoring the situation and advising residents not to travel through deep-flooded areas&mdash;especially at night or without proper guidance. Temporary traffic control and mitigation measures are being implemented to ensure the safety of people and property.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Son La Province:</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">On the night of July 27, torrential rains across 13 communes of the former Song Ma district triggered flash floods and landslides, leaving four people in Chieng So commune dead or missing. Nearly 200 personnel were deployed for search and rescue efforts. Two individuals were swept away in Na Cai 2 village, Chieng So commune.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Dien Bien Province:</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">In Muong Luan commune, a flash flood that struck on the night of July 26 and early morning of July 27 swept away three homes and two community houses, injured two people, and caused major losses of livestock, crops, and infrastructure. Landslides disrupted several inter-village roads. Thanks to early evacuation efforts, no fatalities were reported. Heavy rain and landslides also caused damage and traffic disruptions in Tia Dinh commune.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">Quang Tri Province:</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">From July 25 to midday July 27, continuous heavy rains in the southern mountainous region of Quang Tri led to flooding in upstream rivers, isolating multiple inter-commune and inter-village roads. Several spillways were submerged and blocked by rising water. Authorities established checkpoints and barricades to prevent crossings.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">However, a serious incident occurred on July 26 when <strong>four young men ignored safety barriers</strong> and attempted to drive across a flooded spillway at <strong>Tan Trung village leading to Ban Con, Tan Lap commune</strong>. Taking advantage of a break in guard duty around 5:00 PM, they removed the barricades and tried to cross, resulting in their vehicle being swept away by the floodwaters. Fortunately, all four managed to escape from the vehicle safely. The car, however, was lost and has not yet been recovered.</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 11.0pt;\">According to reports from the provinces affected heavy rains, flash floods, and landslides from the night of July 23 to July 27, 2025, have caused the following damages:</span></strong></p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0in;\" type=\"disc\">\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;\">Affected provinces: Lao Cai, Dien Bien, Son La, Quang Tri, Phu Tho, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Ninh Binh.</li>\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; tab-stops: list .5in;\">\n<p data-start=\"117\" data-end=\"352\"><strong data-start=\"117\" data-end=\"352\">Between July 25 and 27, 2025, heavy rains, flash floods, and landslides affected multiple provinces in northern and north-central Vietnam, including Son La, Dien Bien, Lao Cai, Quang Tri, Phu Tho, Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, and Ninh Binh.</strong></p>\n<ul data-start=\"354\" data-end=\"1313\">\n<li data-start=\"354\" data-end=\"448\">\n<p data-start=\"356\" data-end=\"448\"><strong data-start=\"356\" data-end=\"372\">Human impact</strong>: 2 people confirmed dead and 4 missing in Son La; 2 injured in Dien Bien.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"449\" data-end=\"604\">\n<p data-start=\"451\" data-end=\"604\"><strong data-start=\"451\" data-end=\"462\">Housing</strong>: Over 1,000 houses damaged or collapsed, including 22 houses destroyed in Son La and 987 houses damaged in Phu Tho, Thanh Hoa, and Nghe An.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"605\" data-end=\"709\">\n<p data-start=\"607\" data-end=\"709\"><strong data-start=\"607\" data-end=\"621\">Evacuation</strong>: 66 households were evacuated (40 in Son La, 26 in Lao Cai &mdash; all have returned home).</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"710\" data-end=\"875\">\n<p data-start=\"712\" data-end=\"875\"><strong data-start=\"712\" data-end=\"727\">Agriculture</strong>: Over 54,000 hectares of rice fields were flooded or buried, mainly in Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa; nearly 17 hectares of fish ponds were swept away.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"876\" data-end=\"964\">\n<p data-start=\"878\" data-end=\"964\"><strong data-start=\"878\" data-end=\"891\">Livestock</strong>: More than 400 livestock and 33,000 poultry were killed or swept away.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"965\" data-end=\"1140\">\n<p data-start=\"967\" data-end=\"983\"><strong data-start=\"967\" data-end=\"980\">Transport</strong>:</p>\n<ul data-start=\"986\" data-end=\"1140\">\n<li data-start=\"986\" data-end=\"1095\">\n<p data-start=\"988\" data-end=\"1095\">National and provincial roads reported hundreds of landslide points: 301 in Thanh Hoa and 291 in Nghe An.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"1098\" data-end=\"1140\">\n<p data-start=\"1100\" data-end=\"1140\">5 suspension bridges were washed away.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li data-start=\"1141\" data-end=\"1313\">\n<p data-start=\"1143\" data-end=\"1313\"><strong data-start=\"1143\" data-end=\"1179\">Electricity &amp; telecommunications</strong>: 39 power substations affecting 3,677 households in Son La lost power (over half restored); 21 mobile stations remain out of service.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>",

            "description": "<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As of 22 July 2025, Typhoon Wipha weakened into a tropical depression over northern Viet Nam and later into a low-pressure system along the Viet Nam&ndash;Lao border. Despite weakening, the storm brought widespread heavy rainfall, flash floods, and significant agricultural and housing damage, particularly in Thanh Hoa, Nghe An, Phu Tho, Ninh Binh, and Hung Yen provinces.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Initial reports indicate one person missing and another injured due to flash floods in Nghe An. Over 400 houses were damaged, and more than 119,000 hectares of rice fields were flooded. Local authorities are actively operating pumps to prevent waterlogging. The storm also caused the loss of livestock and disrupted daily life in multiple provinces.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In Nghe An Province, extreme rainfall led to record-breaking flood levels along the Ca River. At several hydrological stations, water levels exceeded Alert Level 3 and surpassed historical flood records. The Ban Ve hydropower reservoir also recorded inflows well above its design capacity, raising the risk of downstream flooding, flash floods, and landslides. Authorities remain on high alert as water levels continue to rise in mid- and downstream areas.</p>",

The National Centre for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting has predicted that downpours will continue in this region from now through August 8, with rainfalls of 50-120mm, even over 180mm, which will continue posing very high risks of floods, flash floods, and landslides.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">From 5 August 5 to 18:00 on 6 August, downpours and floods caused 10 casualties in northern mountainous and midland localities, including seven in Lai Chau, two in Yen Bai and one in Son La, along with heavy property losses, reported the Standing Office of the National Steering Committee.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">According to a report from the National Commanding Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (NDPC) of Lai Chau Province, floods have caused 4 deaths and 3 injuries in Ta Mung commune, Khoen On commune, Than Uyen district, affecting 75 houses, of which 39 are in Nam Nhun district, 25 are in Than Uyen district, 10 are in Phong Tho district, the rest are in Sin Ho district. Over 3ha of rice and tea has been eroded and completely buried.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Floods have caused subsidence and landslides of many roads in the province with a volume of about 23,000 cubic meters of soil and rock. About 14 km of affected roads include: landslides, road talus, longitudinal trenches and some broken sections causing traffic jams on National Highway 4H at Km 272+200, Km 272+922, Km15+ 420, Km293+930, Km270+300, Km196+090. Flood also caused landslides and damaged 4 irrigation works in Than Uyen district.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">A dam containing 1.2 million cubic meters of water, a volume equivalent to 480 Olympic-size swimming pools, in Dak Nong Province has showed signs of cracks following days of heavy rain<span style=\"font-size: 13.5pt; font-family: Georgia, serif; color: #222222; background: white;\">.</span> Dak Nong province has declared an emergency on natural disasters to handle situations. According to the Provincial People's Committee (PPC), from the end of 6 – 7 August, the area experienced prolonged heavy rains, the total rainfall at Dak Ha station was nearly 400 mm.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">By 7 August, the cracks on the foot of the dam spanned around 500 m and were around 150 m deep, and showed no signs of abating. On the right side of the dam, around 10 ha of crops are sinking. An estimated 1 million cubic meters of soil has risk of landslides. The dam itself also has large cracks spanning 10-20 cm. The Dak N’Ting reservoir project cost around VND137 billion ($5.78 million), was built to irrigate around 700 ha of crops in Quang Son Commune. To ensure safety, authorities have blocked entrances into the dam area and evacuated 34 families with around 100 people.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">At around 8:30 a.m on 8 August, the stream of blackish water coming from a reservoir that contains waste from the extraction of copper from ores rushed towards Ta Phoi Commune, Lao Cai province. The wastewater inundated houses and the commune's People’s Committee office. A local said the stream came quickly and without warning, so they could only escape with their lives, not having enough time to take their belongings.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> The Lao Cai People’s Committee said long-lasting rains have contributed to the breakage, and the exact amount of damage incurred is being evaluated. Lao Cai has been seeing rains over the past week, with the highest amount of rainfall seen on Monday night at 80 mm, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting. Heavy rains have triggered erosion at over 140 locations in Lao Cai, damaging more than 30 houses and flooding more than 110 others. Over 340 ha of crops and around 2 ha of aquaculture have also been damaged.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">  </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>",

            "description": "At 7:00 a.m. on October 8, the location of the storm's center was at about 17.6 degrees North latitude; 110.8 degrees East longitude, right on the northwest sea of Hoang Sa archipelago. The strongest wind in the area near the center of the storm is at level 8 (60-75km/h), with gusts level 10. The radius of wind level 6 and gust level 8 is about 120km from the center of the storm. On the 8th of October, in the area from Quang Binh to Quang Ngai and Kon Tum, there is also moderate rain to heavy rain. Common rainfall is 50-80mm, sometimes over 100mm. From tonight, severe rain will decrease rapidly in the above areas. Disaster risk warning level: level 3 (updated at 8:00 am, October 8). By 7:00 am on October 9, the location of the storm's center will be at about 19.3 degrees North latitude; 110.5 degrees East longitude, right on the Southeast area of Hainan Island (China). The strongest wind in the area near the center of the storm is at level 8-9 (60-90km/h), gust level 11. It is forecasted that until 4 a.m. on October 10, the location of the storm's center is about 50 km east of Bach Long Vi island. The strongest wind in the area near the center of the storm is from level 8-9 to level 11. At 4 a.m. on October 11, the location of the tropical depression on the mainland of the North Central provinces. The strongest wind in the area near the center of the tropical depression is strong at level 6, gust level 8. In the North and the North of the Central region, there is a possibility of heavy rain due to the influence of storms. There is a high risk of flash floods and landslides in mountainous areas and local flooding in low-lying, low-lying and riverside areas. Heavy rain flooded the roads in the Central provinces of Vietnam, which made it difficult for thousands of displaced people who were on the way back to their hometowns to avoid the covid pandemic in Ho Chi Minh city and surrounding hotpot outbreak areas. The repatriation was started since 01 of October with the participation of thousands of people walking or riding a motorbike after 4 months stranded in the industrial cities due to the 4th wave of covid outbreak in the South of Vietnam. It is forecasted that from now until the end of this year, the East Sea is likely to have about 5-7 storms and tropical depressions; in which 2-4 storms directly affect the Vietnamese mainland.",

            "description": "From 6 October 2020 the Central region of Viet Nam experienced prolonged, heavy rains that have caused severe and widespread flooding and landslides in eight provinces. This is due to the combination of numerous weather systems – the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone combining with cold air as well as tropical storms Linfa and Nangka. Tropical Storm Linfa made landfall in Quang Nam and Quang Ngai provinces in Central Viet Nam in the morning of 11 October 2020 while Tropical Storm Nangka made landfall in the morning of 14 October 2020 in the northern provinces of Viet Nam which brought along a further 300 – 450 millimeters of rain into the country. On 16 October 2020, another tropical depression (Tropical Depression INVEST 94W) made landfall in the central provinces of Viet Nam. The tropical depression had weakened into a low-pressure area and dissipated after landfall.\n\nBy 24 October 2020, 130 deaths were reported and a further 18 people were missing, according to the Viet Nam Disaster Management Authority (VNDMA). Over 310,000 houses have been flooded, affecting 1.3 million people. Authorities estimated that a total of seven million people have been exposed to the storms, and some five million people are likely to experience worsening conditions because of the flooding situation.\n\nIn the coming days more rainfall has been forecasted to hit the central region, while hydropower plants began releasing water from reservoirs. Typhoon Molave is predicted to make landfall on already-flooded regions of Viet Nam on 28 October 2020. Affected provinces include Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh, Quang Tri, Thura Thien Hue, Da Nang, Quang Nam and Quang Ngai.",
