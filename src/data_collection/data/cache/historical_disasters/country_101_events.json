Moreover, the hostilities have not only inflicted heavy civilian casualties, but have also severely damaged civilian infrastructure, including water and sanitation facilities, cutting off access to clean water for tens of thousands. The lack of effective sanitation services, with most wastewater treatment plants non-operational due to power shortages, heightens the risk of disease outbreaks like cholera, which had already severely affected Lebanon in late 2022. </span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-bottom: 6.0pt; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Lebanon's healthcare sector, already strained by the economic crisis and COVID-19, faces critical shortages of medical staff and supplies, making it increasingly challenging to meet the needs of displaced people and those with chronic health conditions. Lebanese hospitals and health facilities are overwhelmed by the surge in casualties. Out of 207 primary health care centres and dispensaries in conflict-affected areas, 100 are already closed. Mobile Medical Units (MMU) from the Lebanese Red Cross have been deployed to mitigate this, but the overall healthcare system in Lebanon remains severely overwhelmed. </span></p>\r\n</div>",

According to the United Nations, Over 1 million people have been displaced from their homes in the Gaza Strip, and thousands of homes and businesses have been destroyed. The conflict has also caused widespread damage to infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and water and electricity systems.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"Boldintrotext\"><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">In addition to the destruction of property, the conflict has also had a devastating impact on people's lives. The total statistics according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health show that Gaza reported cases since the beginning of the events 4,137 deaths, in addition to more than 13,162 injuries. Most of the injuries are caused by shrapnel and gunshot wounds. The conflict has also caused widespread trauma and psychological distress.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">The total cases dealt with by PRCS ambulance teams since the beginning of the events are (6007) cases, including 1464 fatalities and 4543 injuries.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">The health system in the Gaza Strip is struggling to cope with the influx of casualties.

According to the United Nations Over 187,518 people have been displaced from their homes in the Gaza Strip, and thousands of homes and businesses have been destroyed. The conflict has also caused widespread damage to infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and water and electricity systems. About 3,000 Palestinians in Gaza are still displaced following previous escalations.(1)<br><br>In addition to the destruction of property, the conflict has also had a devastating impact on people's lives. The total statistics according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health that Gaza reported cases since the beginning of the events (1100) Deaths, including (270) children and (240) women, in addition to more than (5339) injuries. The majority of the injuries are caused by shrapnel and gunshot wounds. The conflict has also caused widespread trauma and psychological distress.

Hospitals are overcrowded and medical supplies are running low. The power grid is also damaged, making it difficult to operate hospitals and other essential services. Since the start of the escalation of hostilities, four schools and eight healthcare facilities in Gaza have sustained damage.<br><br>Since the closure of the border, 37 Palestinians have been stuck on the Egyptian side of the border. They are suffering from a lack of food, medication, and shelter.<br><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 104%;\">The already dire humanitarian context inside Gaza is deteriorating further resulting in large-scale displacement inside Gaza and potentially across the Rafah border into Egypt. <br><br>It is Israel will keep all entry and exit points to Gaza, closed for the coming months and as will not allow the opening of a humanitarian corridor for emergency goods and into Gaza.&nbsp; <br><br>Drawing from past escalation events and historical context, Egypt has played a crucial role in facilitating medical treatment for critically injured individuals evacuated to its hospitals, hosting displaced populations, and acting as a channel for humanitarian aid destined for the Gaza Strip, either originating from Egypt or dispatched internationally through it.

Adverse conditions intensified by the end of January, thus deepening the already existing vulnerabilities in the country, particularly for populations that are already at risk. Heavy rain, precipitation, cold temperatures, and strong winds have led to the inundation of roads and heightened traffic safety risks across the country. These factors have also aggravated health risks for those living in inadequate shelter, including displaced Syrians in informal tented settlements (ITS), Palestinians living in undermaintained camps, and Lebanese already struggling with the socio-economic collapse.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">As of the 3rd of February, UNHCR, through Inter-Agency Coordination, reported an estimated 1388 individuals affected by the weather conditions in Syrian ITSs. Moreover, by the 6th of February, the Lebanese Government had not yet estimated the overall number of people affected; however, the local and state media reported an increase in traffic incidents, road closures at high altitudes, and at least 3 cases of drowning related to the winter rains.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">This comes as Lebanon is attempting to recover from a Cholera outbreak in late 2022 and has an overstretched healthcare system.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">In the early morning hours of the 6th of February, a 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Southern Turkey and Northern Syria. The earthquake&rsquo;s epicenter is located 450 km from Beirut and the earthquake was felt in all Lebanese regions at a 4.8 magnitude. Damages are still being assessed and the risks of aftershocks and potential damages could unfold as the severe weather continues.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">LRC through its presence throughout Lebanon and across its operational sectors supported all communities (host and non-host).</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">1.
