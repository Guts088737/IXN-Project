Swiftly, firefighters arrived at the scene, while several tanker trucks departed from the depot, escorted by soldiers and police for protection. Even after the firefighters successfully brought the fire under control later in the day, a thick column of smoke and some flames remained visible.

The injured have been promptly evacuated to Donka and Ignace Deen hospitals, while the deceased have been transported to the respective morgues.

Nevertheless, the ongoing process of registration and assessment will offer a comprehensive understanding of the extent of the damage and the number of individuals requiring assistance.

            "description": "<div>The Ministry of Health health authorities have été́ informed N'Zérékoré Prefectural Health Directorate of the detection of suspected cases of Ebola with symptoms of diarrhea, vomiting, and bleeding in people who participated in the burial of a nurse at the Goueké health center. The nurse died on January 28, 2021 and her funeral took place on February 1 in Goueké. The first investigation carried out counted 7 cases, all over 25 years of age (4 men and 3 women) including 3 cases of death (2 women and 1 man). All cases participated in the nurse's funeral. The first three samples sent to the laboratories in Gueckedou and Conakry proved to be POSITIVE in Ebola. Faced with this situation and in application of the International Health Regulations (IHR), the Guinean government declared an outbreak of Ebola disease in the N'Zérékoré sub-prefecture of Gouecké. A crisis meeting held on February 14, 2021 under the chairmanship of the Minister of Health, in the presence of technical and financial, international and national partners including the Red Cross, at the ANSS recommended the following measures: - Isolation of all suspect cases at the CTEPI in N'Zérékoré and Conakry; - Investigation of the cases to clarify the data, identify other suspect cases and identify all contacts to be isolated; - Dispatch of an emergency investigation mission from the central level to support the local teams in Gouecké; - Activation of the coordination and technical commissions of the Ebola response; - Activation of intersectoral coordination through the One Health platform; - Supply of inputs for awareness, prevention, diagnosis and care; - Opening of a center for the management of cases detected in Gouecké; - Acceleration of the acquisition of Ebola vaccines from the WHO; - Implementation of standard IHR procedures. The N'zerekoré prefecture, located 954 km from the capital of Guinea, is the capital of the prefecture and the capital of the forest region. This region is composed of the prefectures of : Yomou, Beyla, Lola, Macenta, Gueckedou and N'zerekoré. It is in this region that the first wave of EBOLA epidemic was declared and remained for more than 2 years with material and human damage. It should be noted that since the end of the declaration of the epidemic of EBOLA in Guinea in 2016 the prefecture of N'zérékoré had not yet notified any case Gouécké is one of the ten sub-prefectures that make up the prefecture of N'Zérékoré. It is located 42 KM from central N'zérékoré with a total population of about 23545 inhabitants for 3364 households. It is in this locality that we recorded two (02) probable deaths, one (01) confirmed death, one (01) under analysis and two (02) confirmed live cases hospitalized at the CTEPI, and one (02) transferred suspect patient. During this morning's meeting, the ANSS (the national health security agency) in charge of managing epidemics in Guinea proceeded to set up working commissions for the fight against this epidemic. The CRG is represented in the commissions of : Care, Surveillance, Logistics, Communication and Social Mobilization. The Red Cross Prefectural Committee is already active and operational in N'zérékoré, it has managed 2 bodies in N'zérékoré and disinfected the regional hospital in N'zérékoré.</div>",

            "description": "Dans ces cinq dernières années on constate un surpeuplement et une construction de plus en plus anarchique dans les quartiers de la commune urbaine. Notamment : inexistence des canaux d’évacuation, les mécanismes de gestion efficace des ordures, construction dans les basfonds inondables et aux bords des fleuves. Egalement le fleuve Milo traverse la commune urbaine. La combinaison de ces facteurs et la grande pluviométrie de cette année ont occasionné des inondations.\nDu 6 au 7 septembre 2020, 26 sur les 27 quartiers de la commune urbaine et 12 sous-préfectures de Kankan ont connu une forte pluie causant des dégâts majeurs aux personnes.\nSuite à cette inondation le comité préfectoral de la Croix-Rouge de Kankan à travers ces Equipes Communautaires de Réponse aux Catastrophes (NDRT/CDRT) coordonnée par les membres de l’Equipe Nationale de Réponse aux Catastrophes (NDRT/CDRT) avec l’accord des autorités préfectorales, sous préfectorales, communales et celles des quartiers, le comité a déployé 50 volontaires et 5 Superviseurs qui ont mené les évaluations dans ces différentes localités.\nLes résultats de l’évaluation sont les suivants, 9907 ménages affectés, 49536 personnes affectés dont 23 248 hommes et 26 288 femmes, 4 371 enfants de 0 à 5 ans, 1145 femmes enceintes, 1238 femmes allaitantes, 135 personnes handicapées, 946 personnes âgées, 3975 enfants dormant sous moustiquaires, 1101 femmes enceintes dormant sous moustiquaires, 47 cas de diarrhées, 12 blessés, 657 maisons détruites, 1363 personnes déplacées, 551 points d’eau détruits, 75 familles d’accueil, 744 latrines détruites. Il y a également, des impacts énormes sur l’agriculture et l’élevage.\nCes victimes et les autorités sollicitent l’appui des personnes de bonnes volontés et des organisations humanitaires pour se relever des maux dont elles souffrent actuellement.\n",
