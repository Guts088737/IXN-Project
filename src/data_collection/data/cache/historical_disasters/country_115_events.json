The situation is particularly concerning in Port-Louis and its surrounding areas due to favourable climate conditions for mosquito breeding. Since the end of last year few cases of dengue (imported cases) has been registered in the lower Plaine Wilhems district. Unfortunately, with the heavy rainfall episodes of December 2023 and of January 2024 resulted in water accumulation thereby increasing mosquito density and rapidly several cases were registered in the region of Port-Louis and its vicinity, in the northern regions, in district of Plaine Wilhems, and even in Rodrigues. As of 16 February, the cumulative cases since December last year have reached 1,456 including 865 active cases and 2 deaths.",
