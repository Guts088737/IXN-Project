The storm brought heavy rainfall of 6 to 18 inches in various areas. Severe flooding occurred along major rivers, including the Macal, Mopan, Rio Hondo, and Belize Rivers, with downstream communities in the Cayo and Belize Districts most affected. Flash flood alerts remain active, and landslides have been reported on the Maya Mountain slopes.</p>\n<p>Several roads and bridges were rendered impassable, particularly in northern and central regions, including the San Roman and San Antonio roads in Orange Walk and parts of the Coastal and Hummingbird Highways. Urban flooding in Belize City and surrounding areas has disrupted daily life, while low-lying communities in southern Belize experienced strong winds and damage from storm surges of up to 3 feet.</p>\n<p>Approximately 30% of the population has been directly impacted. The National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) has coordinated disaster responses, evacuation, opening emergency shelters in various districts and advising continued vigilance. Communities are urged to prepare for prolonged recovery efforts as floodwaters recede.</p>",

Forecasted to intensify, Sara could reach Category 1 hurricane strength as it approaches the coast of Belize on Sunday. The most vulnerable areas include the Central and Northern Regions, specifically near the Rio Hondo, Macal, Mopan, and Belize Rivers, where flood warnings are in effect due to saturated grounds from previous storms. The storm brings the risk of 5-10 inches of rainfall, which could lead to life-threatening flash floods and landslides, especially on roads like San Roman and San Antonio in the Orange Walk District. Coastal regions may experience minor to moderate coastal flooding, with waves impacting areas where Sara makes landfall.",

The National Meteorological Service's weather station at Half Moon Caye recently reported a wind gust of 43 mph. A general westward motion with an increase in forward speed is expected for the remainder of Saturday, October 19th, 2024, before the tropical storm makes landfall along the coast of Belize in a few hours. No significant strengthening is expected before the system makes landfall.\n\nThe main threat from Tropical Storm Nadine is heavy rainfall. Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches have already been recorded and an additional 4 to 6 inches are possible, especially over northern and central Belize. This could result in flooding.\n\nWinds of 50 miles per hour with higher gusts will occur within the impact area.

The National Meteorological Service's weather station at Half Moon Caye recently reported a wind gust of 43 mph. A general westward motion with an increase in forward speed is expected for the remainder of Saturday, October 19th, 2024, before the tropical storm makes landfall along the coast of Belize in a few hours. No significant strengthening is expected before the system makes landfall.\n\nThe main threat from Tropical Storm Nadine is heavy rainfall. Rainfall totals of 1 to 2 inches have already been recorded and an additional 4 to 6 inches are possible, especially over northern and central Belize. This could result in flooding.\n\nWinds of 50 miles per hour with higher gusts will occur within the impact area.

            "description": "07/02/24- Hurricane Beryl is currently moving west-northwestward across the southeastern Caribbean Sea and is expected to reach the northwestern Caribbean Sea by Thursday. Belize may start feeling the effects of the storm on Thursday night. As of now, Hurricane Beryl is a Category 5 hurricane in the Caribbean Sea. \n\nThere is a high-pressure system expected to force the hurricane on a more westward track. However, there is significant uncertainty regarding the projected area of landfall, with possible impacts ranging from southern Belize to the northern Yucatán Peninsula. The strongest concentration of projected landfall is estimated in northern Belize.\n\nNorthern Belize is already experiencing flooding due to previous rains, which could exacerbate the impact of Hurricane Beryl.\n\nThis hurricane marks a historic event as the first major hurricane in June during what is expected to be an above-average active season. \n\nToday, further evaluations will provide a clearer picture of whether Belize will be directly impacted by the system. \n\nRonald Gordon, Chief MET Officer, stated: \"There is a high level of uncertainty, so we cannot precisely predict the landfall at this time.\"\n\n07/04/24 - NEMO released a fifth advisory informing the general public that at 3:00 a.m. (local time) Hurricane Beryl was located near latitude 18.5N, longitude 81.0W, or about 485 miles east of Corozal Town. Beryl was moving to the west-northwest at 20 mph with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph. A west to west-northwestward motion is expected today until the hurricane makes landfall on the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico later tonight into early Friday morning. Although a direct landfall on Belize is unlikely, this system is likely to produce moderate to heavy rainfall across Belize starting today and continuing through the next 24 to 36 hours. Rainfall totals of 4 to 6 inches are possible with locally higher amounts, especially over the northern districts. This may lead to flooding over low-lying and flood prone areas given that soils in the area are already saturated. Gusty winds to tropical storm force are possible in the extreme north of the country as the system makes landfall later tonight into Friday morning. Strong thunderstorms accompanied by gusty winds and squally conditions are also possible in feeder bands over other areas of the country. Sea conditions are expected to become rough. A Tropical Storm Watch remains in effect from Belize City to Corozal, including the islands of Ambergris Caye and Caye Caulker the forecast shows the affected areas might be the northern coastal communities (Corozal Town, Consejo, Fireburn, Sarteneja, Copper Bank, Chunox, among others). All businesses and offices have been advised to remain open tonight.",

The Mountain Pine Ridge reserve, and the Elijio Panti National Park, are facing severe forest fires that are currently affecting the District of Toledo and the air quality of the Cayo District. The forest fires have been raging in the mountain Pine Ridge area for about three weeks. Twenty-four (24) villages/communities primarily in the wesern portion of Toledo were impacted (Aguacate, Bladen, Big Falls, Blue Creek, Corazon Cree, Crique Jute, Dolores, Eldridgeville, Golden Stream, Jordan, Laguna, Mabil Ha, Mafredi, Theresa, Sundaywood, Silver Creek, San Antonio (Toledo) and Trio), with secondary impact to residents due to smoke/poor air quality which resulted in various respiratory conditions and the suspension of classes earlier this week. Livestock impacted includes chicks, chicken, turkey and ducks. Over 50 different fruits were impacted. The government has mobilized volunteers and defense forces to assist with containing the fire. The main effects in the Toledo were loss of livelihoods and crops, temporary displacement, and respiratory health issues. the main effects in the Cayo District to date are loss of pine forest and smoke propagation throughout the district, impacting many communities for several days. Preliminary impacts in the Cayo District are: the Mountain Pine Ridge area has 9,098.4 hectares of farm land have been destroyed. So far there have been 91 reported cases of respiratory illnesses. Of the farms that were accessible, approximately six hundred (600) acres of agricultural crops and livestock were lost. Once accessible, the remaining villages will be assessed for damages/loss. The environment impact is yet to be determined. The Belize Red Cross supported the response in Toledo with 160 cooked meals for the community volunteers and the Belize Defense Force who are assisting with the Fire. Multiple agencies are coming together to provide meals and other relief items. Focus is on trying to contain fires and providing psychosocial support to the families affected.</p>\n<p>6/6/24:</p>\n<p>Continuous high temperatures and low rainfall across the Belize increased the liklihood of more fires across the country.</p>\n<p>Toledo District: localized fires developed near the San Pedro Colombia village, and has increased significantly in central and southern Toledo. Four hundred (400) families have been impacted by the loss of their livelihoods, subsistence crops in twenty-eight (28) communities. There has also been much environmental damage.</p>\n<p>Cayo District: in the Mountain Pine Ridege Reserve, a lighting strie ignited a fire and it has now spread very quickly across the southern parts of the Reserve. Approximately 32,000 acres have been destroyed and farms have been lost; no numbers so far, but as assessents continue, the number will be updated.</p>\n<div style=\"language: en-US; margin-top: 10.0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: .38in; text-indent: -.38in; text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed; mso-line-break-override: none; word-break: normal; punctuation-wrap: hanging;\">&nbsp;</div>",

A flash flood warning is in effect. Shelters are available countrywide including Belize City. Key partners including the BRC have been meeting and supporting each other. Residents are advised to continue monitoring this system very closely and to follow official information coming from NEMO and the National Met Service NEMO’s has activated emergency evacuation with the BDF and an emergency hotline is 936. Situational reports from volunteers indicate that many communities countrywide are being affected by hurricane Lisa. Many homes have been destroyed and people are in need of shelter and assistance. NEMO has activated shelters and search and rescue but the influx of calls has been overwhelming, shelters are crowded and the current situation is risk to deploy first responders. Phone towers have also been down and the lost of electricity has made it difficult for people to access life-saving rescue. The storm has passed over the Belize district and is now moving over the Cayo District but rains and flooding is still affecting majority of the country.",

The National Meteorological Service of Belize (NMS) informed the public that at 12 midday that Hurricane Lisa was located near latitude 17.3N, longitude 87.7W or about 35 miles East-Southeast of Belize City. Lisa was moving to the west at 14 mph with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph and minimum central pressure of 987 mb. Lisa will continue on a general westward track today she is in the process of making landfall. Lisa is expected to maintain its current intensity or strengthen just a bit more before it makes landfall on the coast of Belize between Dangriga and Belize City. Heavy rainfall from this system has already started to affect the country and that will continue for the remainder of today through to Thursday with amounts of 4-6 inches and locally higher values of up to 8-12 inches. This will result in flooding across low-lying and flood-prone areas of the country and flash flooding especially over the south. Winds of upper category 1 hurricane strength of 80-90 mph with a storm surge of 4-7 feet to the north of where the center makes landfall. Strong gusty winds will result in very rough sea conditions with large battering waves. A state of emergency has be declared for the Belize and Stann Creek districts from 3:00 p.m. today until the \"All Clear\" is given. A curfew will go into effect from dusk today until dawn on Thursday, 3rd November 2022. Only emergency and security agencies are allowed to be on the roads and streets during this period. Volunteers report roofs, trees, and power lines have already become hazards in some communities as the storm makes its way over the country. Many communities have been experiencing flooding from the outer bands of the hurricane. Media houses are reporting heavy rainfall, winds, and flooding in various parts of the country.",

The National Meteorological Service of Belize and the National Emergency Management Organization informs the general public that at 7:00 p.m. (local time) Hurricane Lisa was located near latitude 16.7N, longitude 84.0W or about 285 miles east of Belize City. Lisa was moving to the west at 15 mph with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and minimum central pressure of 996 mb. This system will bring heavy rainfall with amounts of 4-6 inches and locally higher values of up to 8-12 inches starting on Wednesday and continuing through Thursday, which will result in flooding across low-lying and flood prone areas of the country and flash flooding especially over the south. Winds of upper category 1 hurricane strength of 90-95 mph or category 2 strength of 96 -110 mph are expected near the landfall location with a storm surge of 4-7 feet to the north of where the centre makes landfall. Strong gusty winds will result in very rough sea conditions with large battering waves.",

        "summary": "<p>The direct impact of Hurricane Lisa comes just 2 weeks after the country experienced heavy rains and associated flooding following the passage of Tropical Storm Julia. According to NEMO, flooding as a result of tropical storm Julia affected roughly 30 communities in southern and central Belize and approximately 3,000 families had been directly or indirectly impacted.</p>\r\n<p>In 2020, flooding associated with the passage of Hurricanes Eta and Iota cut off several communities, with Cayo, Stann Creek, and Belize districts being most affected. Approximately 15% of the total population in Belize was impacted. In response to these historic floods, the Belize Red Cross launched a DREF operation that targeted 5,000 people. The operation supported the distribution of household items, WASH activities and multi-purpose cash Page 3 / 18 assistance.</p>\r\n<p>It should be noted that the recent impacts outlined above were not the result of a direct impact of a hydro meteorological hazard. However, hurricane Lisa directly impacted Belize and so the scale of impact can be reasonably expected to exceed these 2 previous events. Belize Red Cross (BRC) has received reports through staff, volunteers, and the National Emergency Management Office (NEMO) that several communities have been affected. Major areas impacted (hardest hit) are communities in Belize, Stann Creek and Toledo Districts as forecasted by the NEMO and Meteorological services. However there has also been some significant impacts in Cayo and Orange Districts.</p>\r\n<p>Initial close estimates indicate overall 333,549 people in the country were at risk from impacts from the system. According to NEMO, at least 39% of the total population of Belize (approximately 160,000 people) was most affected by Hurricane Lisa. Only in the district of Belize, more than 90,000 people are reported to have been impacted. Among the effects, substantial damage has been reported to property. It is estimated that approximately 500 houses have been completely destroyed, while more than 5,000 houses have been partially destroyed in the Belize District. Partial damage ranged from roofs being blown off, structures being partially destroyed, ground floors being flooded and household goods being destroyed by wind and water. Initial estimates of losses to the housing sector amounts to some BZD 20 million (Approximately USD 10 million).</p>\r\n<p>The Relief Supplies and Management Subcommittee of the National Emergency Management Organization (NEMO) has indicated the need to provide immediate relief to some estimated 5,000 plus families in the Belize District, and up to 1,000 families in the Stann Creek District. The estimated number of families affected in the Cayo, Orange Walk and Corozal districts can reach as much as 500 families.</p>\r\n<p>Food, water, hygiene kits, bedding, cleaning supplies, tarpaulins, buckets, PPEs, power washers, construction and roofing material are the main items needed for the affected population. In addition, further damage and needs assessments (DANA) will be conducted to ensure the most appropriate provision support of affected population. Multi-Purpose Cash will be utilized as a modality for provision of support to ensure dignity, freedom of choice and facilitate livelihood reactivation where markets/business can accommodate.</p>",

Belize received torrential rains during Saturday and Sunday over the entire country of Belize. The southern districts of Toledo and Stann Creek and the western district of Cayo began to experience floods on Sunday, Oct. 9th, like that in 2020 in the same districts due to Hurricane Eta and Iota. Heavy rains being dumped on neighbouring countries of Nicaragua, Honduras and Guatemala, south and west of Belize have&nbsp; contributed to the rivers in Belize rising and overflowing their banks. It is expected that rivers will continue to rise during this week and next and floods will extend to the Belize District through the Belize River Valley.</p>",

The most likely path is for the center to make landfall on Nicaragua and then move across to Honduras while weakening rapidly over the mountainous terrain. In that case it won't be a strong wind producer for Belize but will likely still produce heavy rainfall with potential flooding especially over the south. Rainfall forecast to peak on Monday with daily totals of 4 to 6 inches and locally higher amounts. Worse case, but less likely scenario, is the center moving on the northern edge of the cone. In that case Belize could be dealing with a hurricane making landfall late on Monday on the country. Will provide another update later today.",

The latter four communities along the Moho River were inaccessible due to the submerged Blue Creek bridge being impassible. Mafredi had one large field that was completely submerged. The land is higher and thus, not totally all families were affected. Displaced families had already returned to their homes from shelters. Those who had concrete floors had already started cleaning their homes and those with dirt floors, although soaked, were throwing sand to get them dry. Most families lost a few chickens.",

            "description": "On November 4th, 2020 a flood warning for Central and Southern Belize was issued by the National Hydrological Service. This flood warning was in effect for rivers, streams, creeks and waterways in central and southern Belize. The National Hydrological Services has issued a flood report and forecast which indicates that in certain rivers and waterways, water levels are steadily rising above normal. On the Belize River, water levels are above normal and rising and the same is happening on the Macal and Mopan Rivers. In southern Belize, there is the minimal rise of water levels for the Sittee River at Kendal Bridge, the Swasey and Bladen branch of Money River as well as the Rio Grande in San Pedro Columbia. \nOn November 5th and 6th , all of Belize is facing a national flooding event - caused by the Hurricane Eta storm system.  Eta has moved on and is now a Tropical depression heading northeast to Cuba. Fortunately, there have been no reports of loss of life, however there is plenty loss of property and damage to residences and families dislocated by the flood. The flooding started from November 4th but came on much heavier on November 5th - totally submerging San Ignacio as the Macal river was running in the streets.  The nearby villages of Bullett Tree and Calla Creek were trapped and the relevant teams were sent on rescue missions.  Also out west, the new bridge near Roaring Creek held up, but the highway approaches to it were submerged in a massive rise of the river.  \nWhile the greatest flooding is concentrated in the west, the entire country has been affected.  NEMO reports roads that are flooded and or impassable are the Bullet Tree and Santa Familia roads, the Calla Creek road, Santa Rosa road to Calla Creek, More Tomorrow M & S road, Sittee River bypass to Hopkins, and the Coastal Road from Hope Creek to Gales Point junction. All crossings in the Cayo district are flooded or at risk to flood except the main crossings, Hawkesworth and the Santa Elena bypass (new) bridge The Cayo district has been the epicenter of the flood, however, both Belize District and Stann Creek District have been affected. \nAccording to NEMO, approximately 30,000 persons have been affected by this flood. There are currently 6 shelters opened countrywide with 78 persons and more persons are expected to fill these shelters as rescue missions are currently underway. The United States, Mexico and International Financial Institutions are standing by to provide assistance with food, water and shelter as needed.

BRC hopes to assist at least 1000 families countrywide with food and hygiene supplies. An assessment will be conducted to determine the extent of damages to those affected.",

            "description": "Hurricane Nana, Category 1, made landfall around midnight on September 2nd, 2020, on southern Belize, between Dangriga Town and Placencia Village in the Stann Creek District. This small hurricane in radius had hurricane winds extending 10 miles from the center. The west-southwest track took it well south of Belize City, avoiding a direct hit. Belize is now in the all clear phase. Although assessments are still ongoing, preliminary reports reaching Belize Breaking News Belize (media) is that banana and plantain farms in southern Belize have lost hundreds of acres of crops. Estimates shared are that over 800 acres from three major farms have been destroyed. There has been no loss of human life and minimal structural damage done to houses, mostly in the Stann Creek District.",
