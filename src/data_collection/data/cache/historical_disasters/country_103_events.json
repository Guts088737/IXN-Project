According to a joint assessment conducted by the NDMA local community structures and the Liberian Red Cross Community-Based Action Teams (CBATs) during the last five days in Monrovia and adjacent communities, about 35 communities have reported experiencing flooding over the last 72 hours. Data reported say that about 22,060 persons are caught up in the floods leading to temporary displacement, loss of valuable household items, and huge exposure to risks of disease outbreaks, loss of habitat (sheltering opportunities), livelihoods mechanisms, and water source pollution. About 60% of the affected people are women, children, and other vulnerable groups of people including physically challenged, single mothers, among others seeking shelter with neighbors and relatives in adjacent unflooded communities. <span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\">&nbsp;</span></span></p>",

Areas especially affected are Kru Town; Gbarnga City and Monrovia coastal and urban side as well as the surrounding areas. In total, around 15,200 people are reported to be affected by both urban and coastal floods which swept away infrastructure, fishing settlements, houses, communities' facilities etc. On 4th September, Monrovia and its environs recorded the major impact following the five days cumulative rains from 30 August that affected approximately 12,450 persons (1,778 HHs). The affected are mostly surrounding Moronvia or bordering Sierra Leone and the river crossing the North Est of the country.</p>\r\n<p>The Liberia Meteorological Department has predicted continuous rains in September and October 2023 across all counties in the country. Obviously, with continuous heavy rainfall, it could trigger additional flooding in low-lying communities near rivers and streams. Urban flooding is also possible in areas with poor drainage systems. Sites downstream from large rivers are also vulnerable to flash flooding after relatively short periods of intense rainfall. These rains can cause further damage to infrastructure, road closures, and contamination.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<div> </div>",

            "description": "Monkey pox is an illness caused by the monkey pox virus. It is a viral zoonotic infection, meaning that it can spread from animals to humans. It can also spread from person to person. Monkey pox can cause a range of signs and symptoms.  While some people have mild symptoms, others may develop more serious symptoms and need care in a health facility. Those at higher risk for severe disease or complications include people who are pregnant, children and persons that are immunocompromised.\nThe most common symptoms of monkey pox include FEVER, HEADACHE, MUSCLE ACHES, BACK PAIN, LOW ENERGY, and SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES. This is followed or accompanied by the development of a rash which can last for two to three weeks. The rash can be found on the face, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, eyes, mouth, throat, groin, and genital and/or anal regions of the body. The number of lesions can range from one to several thousand. Lesions begin flat, then fill with liquid before they crust over, dry up and fall off, with a fresh layer of skin forming underneath.\nSymptoms of Monkey pox  include:\n•\tFever\n•\tHeadache\n•\tMuscle aches and backache\n•\tSwollen lymph nodes\n•\tChills\n•\tExhaustion\n•\tA rash that can look like pimples or blisters that appears on the face, inside the mouth, and on other parts of the body, like the hands, feet, chest, genitals, or anus.\nThe rash goes through different stages before healing completely. The illness typically lasts 2-4 weeks. Sometimes, people get a rash first, followed by other symptoms. Others only experience a rash.",

The National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) has reported a total of 90,640 (17,000 households) are affected across these counties as a result of the floods. A total of 55 communities in these counties are reported affected; 46 of those communities are in Montserrado County.  Three (3) deaths (children) have been reported and 1 is confirmed. The government of Liberia through the NDMA has declared the situation an emergency.

Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Francis Kateh, said there were reports of deaths in the wake of the outbreak, but he was not sure if they were all measles-related. He told a radio program on Wednesday, 20th April that the outbreak was a result of low immunization rates, especially during the Covid-19 outbreak and duration. Parents have held back from availing their children of immunization due to vaccine resistance to COVID-19. \nAccording to the National Public Health Institute’s weekly update on the Liberia Public Health Surveillance & Response System (Reporting Week 14; Reporting Period: April 4-10) on measles, 204 suspected cases including 3 deaths were reported. Montserrado County accounts for 66% (135 cases) of the total cases reported. \nThe Government has reported major capacity challenges to adequately address the response. They are identifying community cases and making referrals to health facilities in the counties. The Ministry has also confirmed a planned circumscribed vaccination campaign shortly. \nBreakdown of cases per county includes Montserrado County (135), Nimba (21), Grand Bassa (17), Lofa (12), Margibi (8), Grand Gedeh (3), Sinoe (2), Grand Cape Mount (2), River Gee (1), Maryland (1), Grand Kru (1), and Bomi (1).\n\nAccording to the MoH, children are mostly affected by the outbreak. \n",

All cases are from one health district (Sanniquellie Mah); communities – Glehnlu, LPMC. Success, Guinea Road, and Gbarpa. Other three new cases have been suspected involving 1 female and two males and are currently in isolation with required medical attention. At the moment, there is no further spread beyond the index health district. Investigation of the cases by the District Health Team with support from the County Health Team and WHO has been ongoing. A total of 79 contacts have been line-listed to-date of which 47 are health workers. The outbreak is still at the level of the District and County health Teams’ control. The MoH at the national level continues to provide remote technical support while the NCHT carries on the response along with the district officers. \n\nThe NCHT have expressed challenge of body bags as a major constraint in this type of infectious respond. Therefore, the CHT is asking the LNRCS to support with body bags. IMS meetings are ongoing at the moment in Nimba County every Wednesday; hence the Surveillance Team meets daily after their regular field visits. ",
