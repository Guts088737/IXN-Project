Numbers from last week indicate that volunteers were active in 16 out of 18 Red Cross-districts (regions). 499 volunteers were actively engaged in support for refugees, such as providing activities and providing practical assistance. As many refugees have stayed at shelters throughout the summer, the Norwegian Red Cross has been present with activities. Activities such as summer camps, amusement parks, while maintaining Norwegian speaking sessions. These activities will continue into the fall. As refugees are being given a permanent residence, many local branches are currently engaged in making sure that refugees have access to local activities provided by the Norwegian Red Cross where they live.</span></p>",

            "description": "As of early June, close to 20 000 Ukrainian refugees have been registered in Norway. During the last two months, Norway has seen a decrease in the number of refugees that are arriving in Norway. Now, approximately 50-60 refugees are registered from Ukraine every day. About 1/3 of the refugees have been given a more permanent residence, while many are still waiting for a permanent residence and are living at shelters. As there have been fewer arrivals than what was expected, the Norwegian authorities are now closing many of the temporary shelters that were put up in March and April. \n\nVolunteers in the Norwegian Red Cross continue to be present for refugees and are providing activities for the refugees at shelters. Numbers from last week indicate that volunteers were active in 17 out of 18 Red Cross-districts (regions). 1 095 volunteers were actively engaged in support for refugees, such as providing activities and providing practical assistance. As many refugees will continue to live at shelters throughout the summer, the Norwegian Red Cross assumes that activities at shelters will continue for some time. As refugees are being given a permanent residence, many local branches are currently engaged in making sure that refugees have access to local activities provided by the Norwegian Red Cross where they live. \n\nIn May, the Norwegian Red Cross discontinued (terminated) its crisis management, and is now handling the situation through our ordinary organisation.

During the past week, the number of refugees arriving in Norway have decreased (around 100 daily, as opposed to 500 daily in March). As of April 19th, volunteers from the Norwegian Red Cross were present at shelters/asylum reception centres in 15 out of 18 districts (regions).  1 261 volunteers are currently present at 56 shelters/asylum reception centres (out of a total of 107 shelters/asylum reception centres). Volunteers continue to provide practical support to the reception centres and to be present for the refugees residing in Norway. During the Easter holiday last week, volunteers brought refugees out on trips, such as a boat trip in Rogaland county. ",

            "description": "\nAfter the military invasion of Ukraine on February 24th 2022, The Norwegian Red Cross has worked intensively to prepare it's domestic response to assist refugees that are arriving in Norway and that are in need of immediate assistance. As of March 16th, just above 2000 refugees have been registered seeking asylum in Norway from February 24th to March 14th. This number includes applicants for asylum seekers from different countries than Ukraine, however it is predominantly refugees from Ukraine that are arriving. \n\nThe immigration authorities have estimated that 35 000 asylum seekers will arrive in Norway during 2022, howevert this does not include asylum seekers that arrive as part of an organised response or initiatives coordinated between countries to relieve the burden in Ukraine and in neighbouring countries. All asylum seekers that are Ukranian citizens and that arrive in Norway, are automatically awared refugee status in Norway. This applies also to asylum seekers in Ukraine that had a refugee status prior to February 24th, 2022. Persons that prior to February 24th did not have a refugee status in Ukraine og in neighbouring countries, will have to apply for a refugee status in accordance with the ordinary mechanisms. \n\nThe Norwegian Red Cross estimates that there are more refugees in Norway as of present than those that have been registered as asylum seekers with the immigration authorities. Some Ukranian citizens have arrived and are living with friends and family, and have yet to be registered. The number of total arrivals since February 24th, is currently not known. \n\nThe Norwegian Red Cross is working intensively to be present for refugees arriving in Norway. As of March 16th, volunteers from The Norwegian Red Cross are present at four reception centres where refugees are temporarily staying. As shelters and reception centres are being prepared across Norway, our volunteers are standing by, ready to assist as soon as it is needed. Volunteers have also been present at the National Arrival Centre in Råde since February 24th, where all refugees that arrive in Norway are registered. As of March 16th, refugees get registered in their local police districts, which we assume will lead to many more Ukrainian citizens being registered with the authorities. \n\nThe Norwegian Red Cross is now preparing to be present at all shelters/reception centres in Norway where refugees arrive. We are also currently working hard to provide information to our volunteers about what is needed, to prepare guidelines and making necessary courses available for our volunteers. The Norwegian Red Cross are also currently being contacted by many in the population and businesses who wants to donate medical aid, clothes and other items, and who wants to provide aid to refugees that are arriving. We are currently coordinating our response in close dialogue with the Norwegian Immigrant Authorities and other volunteer organisations and working to assess the humanitarian needs of those who are arriving, and determining how we can best be of assistance to the government to coordinate our response effectively and ensure that those that are arriving are taken care of both initially and in a longer time-perspective. \n",
