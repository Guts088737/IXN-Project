According to the United Nations, Over 1 million people have been displaced from their homes in the Gaza Strip, and thousands of homes and businesses have been destroyed. The conflict has also caused widespread damage to infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and water and electricity systems.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"Boldintrotext\"><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">In addition to the destruction of property, the conflict has also had a devastating impact on people's lives. The total statistics according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health show that Gaza reported cases since the beginning of the events 4,137 deaths, in addition to more than 13,162 injuries. Most of the injuries are caused by shrapnel and gunshot wounds. The conflict has also caused widespread trauma and psychological distress.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">The total cases dealt with by PRCS ambulance teams since the beginning of the events are (6007) cases, including 1464 fatalities and 4543 injuries.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">The health system in the Gaza Strip is struggling to cope with the influx of casualties. Hospitals are overcrowded, and medical supplies are running low. The power grid is also damaged, making it difficult to operate hospitals and other essential services. Since the start of the escalation of hostilities, four schools and eight healthcare facilities in Gaza have sustained damage.</span><br><br><strong><a name=\"_Hlk148628161\"></a><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #212121;\">Since the closure of the border, 105 Palestinians have been stuck on the Egyptian side of the border.

The Egyptian Red Crescent is the only organization with access to North Sinai and already holds operations and projects in the area.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"Boldintrotext\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk148628011;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">Today on the 21st of October 2023, a total of 20 ERCS trucks crossed the Rafah borders carrying aid that is based on the coordinated needs of PRCS, which included </span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Boldintrotext\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk148628011;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">Six trucks carrying: Medicine</span></span></li>\n<li class=\"Boldintrotext\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk148628011;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">Seven trucks: Medical Consumbles</span></span></li>\n<li class=\"Boldintrotext\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk148628011;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">Five trucks: Food Items.</span></span></li>\n<li class=\"Boldintrotext\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk148628011;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">Two trucks: Water</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Boldintrotext\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk148628011;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">The trucks make their way into Gaza through the PRCS, in coordination with authorities on both sides to ensure the safe delivery of items.&nbsp;</span></span></p>",

According to the United Nations Over 187,518 people have been displaced from their homes in the Gaza Strip, and thousands of homes and businesses have been destroyed. The conflict has also caused widespread damage to infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and water and electricity systems. About 3,000 Palestinians in Gaza are still displaced following previous escalations.(1)<br><br>In addition to the destruction of property, the conflict has also had a devastating impact on people's lives. The total statistics according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health that Gaza reported cases since the beginning of the events (1100) Deaths, including (270) children and (240) women, in addition to more than (5339) injuries. The majority of the injuries are caused by shrapnel and gunshot wounds. The conflict has also caused widespread trauma and psychological distress.

Hospitals are overcrowded and medical supplies are running low. The power grid is also damaged, making it difficult to operate hospitals and other essential services. Since the start of the escalation of hostilities, four schools and eight healthcare facilities in Gaza have sustained damage.<br><br>Since the closure of the border, 37 Palestinians have been stuck on the Egyptian side of the border.

            "description": "On Wednesday February 17th, 2021, severe and large weather fluctuations have begun; as a very cold air mass associated with a polar depression entered the Kingdom's atmosphere, classified as a 4th degree depression according to the Arab weather scale of the severity of the depressions. The Kingdom's airspace crossed a snowy, \"highly effective\" and frigid air front and snow falls are expected in areas that exceed 800 meters above sea level from the north and center of the Kingdom, extending over different periods and later it will reach the heights of Karak and Tafila, while these rains are sometimes heavy and accompanied by the occurrence of thunder and heavy showers of hail in the rest of the regions in the midst of stormy weather and winds that slow some of their gusts up to 100 km/hour.\nSuch Conditions could lead to houses being flooded by water trapping people in their homes, flashfloods, human casualties, people missing, deaths, road blockages, hindering transportation and cutting power supplies.\nIts impact is expected to end by Thursday February 18th, 2021 evening hours, as per to the strength of the accompanying weather phenomena, such as heavy rain, snowfall, strong winds, reduced temperatures and heavy thunderstorms and showers of hail.",
