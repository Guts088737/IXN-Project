This season was characterized by significantly reduced rainfall, along with poor spatial and temporal distribution, resulting in prolonged drought conditions across all regions of the country. The crisis has been worsening since 2022 due to consecutive failed rainy seasons and the compounding effects of previous droughts.<br>The situation is particularly dire in <strong>Puntland and Somaliland</strong>, where the drought’s impact is intensifying by the day. These regions received little to no rainfall during the Deyr season, with only a few areas experiencing light showers. In response, Puntland issued a drought appeal on 8 April 2025, followed by Somaliland on 6 April 2025. The situation is ongoing, and forecasts for below-normal rainfall in the current Gu rainy season (April–June 2025) are starting to materialize. If they continue to hold true until the end of the season, it is projected that <strong>784,000 people will fall into IPC Phase 4 (Emergency), and 3.8 million people into IPC Phase 3 (Crisis)</strong>, according to the IPC food insecurity report.",

Among these cases, four tested positive for Leishmania IgG through Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs),<br>raising concerns about the potential emergence of a localized outbreak. Subsequent laboratory analysis confirmed two fatalities from<br>Rugay and Cirshiida in Erigavo district, highlighting the severity of the situation. The most recent case (01) was officially confirmed on<br>February 26, 2025, as a kalzar type, further underscoring the ongoing transmission risk.<br>Despite these hospital-reported cases, the extent of leishmaniasis (Visceral Leishmaniasis—Kala-Azar) within the broader community<br>remains uncertain due to limited surveillance data. The lack of comprehensive epidemiological insights poses challenges in assessing<br>transmission dynamics and potential risk factors, necessitating an urgent and coordinated response.<br>On March 2, 2025, in response to the worsening situation, the Ministry of Health Development (MoHD) has formally issued a request<br>letter to urgently inform the partners of the critical public health concerns regarding the recent outbreak of Leishmaniasis in the Sanaag<br>region, triggering an appeal to humanitarian partners for urgent intervention. This request serves as an official call for support, urging<br>international and local organizations to assist in disease control, medical treatment, and prevention efforts. The trigger date, marked by<br>the release of this request letter, signifies the government's acknowledgment of the crisis and its need for external aid to combat the<br>outbreak effectively",

The most affected people by this disaster are approximately 4,416 internally displaced people (736 HH) people living in 18 of the 20 recorded camps. These 18 camps around Galkayo are home to approximately 40,254 internally displaced persons (IDP) or 6,709 households, based on the needs assessment. The Somali Red Crescent Society (SRCS) staff and volunteers from Galkayo Branch quickly mobilised and began to support the affected communities and carried out a rapid assessment of the damage. On 11 May, SRCS joined an interagency rapid assessment in all the 18 affected IDP camps, led by North Galkacyo Municipality in coordination with OCHA, to which other partners1 participated.</p>\r\n<p>As per the initial information from the SRCS and interagency rapid assessment, the IDP settlements were the most affected by the rains and windstorms, which destroyed IDP shelters and other communal assets such as latrines, health facilities, schools, etc. The assessment reports that about 4,416 internally displaced people (736 HH) were affected and in need of humanitarian assistance. Based on this, SRCS is requesting IFRC support through the Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) to provide relief to the most vulnerable families targeted in the IDP settlements in coordination with the local government and humanitarian agencies. Through the inter-agency coordination meeting conducted on 12 May 2022, it was agreed that SRCS will support the affected people with the ongoing response by providing emergency shelters, NFIs, WASH, Food security and livelihood, CEA and PGI, and a mobile health team. </p>",

The fire completely destroyed the 2,000 shops and stalls that were based there, and alongside the livelihoods of about 10,000 people that used to work in this market daily. The fire that was eventually controlled on Saturday morning, has severely injured 67 people, out of which 29 needed to be transported by SRCS ambulances to the hospital.

Most of the people are originally from Southwest (SWS) and Hirshabelle states, Banadir and a few from Ethiopia. According to the Puntland Ministry of Interior (MoI), more than 2,800 of the people evicted have arrived in Gaalkacyo and Harfo in the Mudug Region of Puntland between 3 and 5 October 2021. Others have been supported by the Puntland and SWS authorities with onward transportation, mainly to their place of origin in SWS, Hirshabelle and Banadir. Some individuals have moved onwards on their own accord or settled with relatives in Gaalkacyo. Based on information received by the SRCS Gaalkacyo branch, between 10,000 to 14,000 people are expected to depart from Laascaanood and Erigabo coming months. A large part of those people is already in Gaalkacyo and more are expected to reach Gaalkacyo if the deportation continues in the coming days. Puntland and Somalia officials have called for the Somaliland government to cancel or delay these evictions, but the president of Somaliland, Musse Bihi has declared that the deportation process will be continuing until all the people from Puntland, South and Central Somalia have been fully evicted from Somaliland soil. This means evacuees from Hargeisa, Burco and other large Somaliland towns can also be expected in the coming days. </p>",

        "summary": "<p>The Government of Somalia declared a National Emergency due to the Drought situation and called for support in responding to the humanitarian crisis. According to UNOCHA Somalia situational Update of April 26th 2021 and the IFRC Regional Information Bulletin (RIB), the already dire humanitarian situation in Somalia has been deteriorating since the failed Deyr short rains late 2020.</p>\r\n<p>This affected crop production, pasture regeneration and failed to sufficiently replenish water sources for communities in the eight (8) targeted districts.</p>\r\n<p>The earliest onset of the prolonged Jilaal dry season in late 2020 depleted the little pasture and water sources available for the very vulnerable households in these districts. The late onset of the insufficient and poorly distributed Guu long rains 2021 is projected to be inadequate till June, unlikely to sufficiently replenish water sources and regenerate pasture. The back-to-back poor performance of the Deyr and Guu with a harsh Jilaal in-between eroded the resilience of the targeted communities.</p>\r\n<p>Access to clean water is compromised with the cost of water spiking by 60% in these districts and vulnerable households having to travel long distances in search of water. Vulnerable households have resorted to negative coping strategies. Poor hygiene practices are on the rise putting the health and nutrition of vulnerable &lt;5-year-olds and pregnant women at increased risk. Herders are resorting to hand-feeding their livestock with locally produced cereals. This has caused cereal prices to increase by at least 30% and livestock disease are being reported.</p>",
