On 29thAugust 2024, Mangochi District Heath Office was alerted on a cluster of suspected measles cases in a village under Mkuchinga Jwambone Health Center. Six samples were collected for laboratory investigation at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe. Three samples were confirmed positive for Measles on 9th September, 2024. The ages of the confirmed measles cases are seven months, five and seven years old. Measles, is a highly infectious viral disease characterized by a generalized rash, fever, running nose and at least cough or Coryza or red-eye. It spreads through direct contact with mouth or nasal droplets when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. While the disease can affect anyone, unvaccinated or under vaccinated under five children and pregnant mothers are at high risk of contracting and developing severe form of the disease. If untreated, measles can cause serious complications like blindness or death. It is therefore, important to seek urgent medical help. There is no specific treatment for measles. The symptoms are usually mild and self-resolving within a period of about one week. \nCommunities are advised to take preventive measures as the disease has the potential to affect more people. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. Ministry of Health with support from its partners including Malawi Red Cross is encouraging parents to vaccinate their children.",

Measles, is a highly infectious viral disease characterized by a generalized rash, fever, running nose and at least cough or Coryza or red-eye. It spreads through direct contact with mouth or nasal droplets when an infected person breathes, coughs or sneezes. While the disease can affect anyone, unvaccinated or under vaccinated under five children and pregnant mothers are at high risk of contracting and developing severe form of the disease. If untreated, measles can cause serious complications like blindness or death. It is therefore, important to seek urgent medical help. There is no specific treatment for measles. The symptoms are usually mild and self-resolving within a period of about one week. \nCommunities are advised to take preventive measures as the disease has the potential to affect more people. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent measles. Ministry of Health with support from its partners including Malawi Red Cross is encouraging parents to vaccinate their children.",

The warning pointed out that the cyclone, which was expected to be associated with heavy rainfall exceeding\n100mm in 24 hours, might trigger the occurrence of flash floods from Saturday 12th March to Sunday the 13th of March, 2022, with most parts of the southern region at risk of being affected.\nWidespread floods, damages to public infrastructures and private homes as well as interruption of basic services are already being reported, as heavy rains and strong winds continue to hit the country. The department of climate change and meteorogical services issued a red warning for heavy rains and strong winds for the the districts of Mulanje, Nsanje, Chikwawa, Phalombe, Zomba, Machinga, Thyolo, Chiradzulu, Blantyre and Mangochi as districts at risk of being affected by the looming cyclone over the period between 11 and 14 March. The Inter-agency assessment team from various cluster representation has been deployed to support the district which have been affected by the cyclone Gombe.\nFollowing the disaster, Zomba district has reported that over 2, 286 houses have been completely damaged in all the respective 7 T/As which have been affected by the disaster. The affected people have been displaced in 29 camps which have been established across the affected areas. \nIn Phalombe, the situation on the ground remains critical as over 15,000HH have been affected by the disaster, The district has received reports on the camps which have been established but they are yet to verify on the actual number of the people staying at the camps as most of the access roads are still impassable to carry out a verified assessment. \nIn Nsanje 2 camps have been established, many of the affected people have been displaced and have integrated themselves in the camps which were established after the effect of cyclone Ana. The integration is likely to pose a threat for congestion in the camps which may end up influencing disease breakouts and affect issues of dignity among family members. \nWith the impact of the disaster, the districts are under pressure to source resources to respond to the affected households as many were already struggling to support the HH which were affected by the cyclone Ana.\nMalawi Red Cross and the Department of Disaster and Management Affairs (DoDMA) in the districts and community-level structures are continuing to carry out Disaster Needs Assessment. However, basing on the preliminary reports it is already indicating that the below-mentioned interventions will be a priority:\no\tDetailed disaster needs assessment \no\tSupport to provision of food items to the affected beneficiaries  \no\tSupport to provision of shelter items to the affected beneficiaries \no\tWASH interventions to ensure good camp management practices are being followed \n",

            "summary": "AN UPDATE ON CONFIRMED POLIO CASE IN MALAWI, 21 FEBRUARY 2022",
            "description": "The Ministry of Health has reported a confirmed Polio or Poliomyelitis case from Lilongwe districts (WHO Media Release, 17th February 2022). Poliovirus causes irreversible paralysis disease mainly in children zero to fifteen years of age. It also has a potential to infect immunocompromised adults. Normally a child would present to a health facility with acute onset of limb weakness which progresses to paralysis. If it is a leg or an arm, it may become relatively smaller (wasted) than the normal body mass and loses function because it is weaker than the rest of the body. \n\nIt is a disabling and life threatening disease. Polio is an infectious disease and can be passed from one person to another through ingestion of food or water which is contaminated with polio virus. The high risk group are those that are unvaccinated or those that have received fewer doses of polio vaccines. \n\nThe Ministry of Health with support from partners has put in place strategies for elimination of Polio in the Country. These strategies are in line with the strategies recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) through the Global Polio End Game Strategy. Vaccines are the most effective and available prevention strategy for this disease in addition to improved water and sanitation practices. Worldwide, we still have few countries mainly outside Africa where Wild Polio Virus type 1 is endemic.\n\nThe Malawi Government through the Ministry of Health established the National Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) in 1979 to deal with vaccine preventable diseases including Polio, Measles and Neonatal Tetanus. These diseases are undergoing eradication and elimination. The Ministry has therefore intensified surveillance for these diseases in line with the WHO recommendations. Malawi has sustained good coverage of all its vaccine antigen above 80% now for two decades and polio vaccine is no exception. Like many other countries in the world, Malawi provides polio vaccine that targets Polio virus type 1 and type 3 following the eradication of Polio virus type 2 many years back. We are also vaccinating our children with Inactivated Polio Virus vaccine with sustained good coverage to date since introduction in 2018.\n\nThe Immunization program also joined the global efforts to eradicate polio completely and as such we have been implementing polio disease surveillance to ensure that we are able to pick any polio case within our communities and avoid further spread. Our partners like WHO, UNICEF and many others have been key stakeholders in strengthening the Global Polio Eradication Strategy. The last polio case in Malawi was reported in 1992 meaning that this is the first case in thirty years. Malawi also obtained a Polio free status in 2005 while the WHO African region received its Polio free status certificate in the year 2020. \n\nThese are remarkable milestones in the polio eradication initiative in the country. In practice, any suspected child from zero to fifteen years of age coming with acute onset of flaccid paralysis or weakness is supposed to be reported as a suspected Polio case. The requirement is to report 2 non-polio AFP per 100000 as well as adequate stool specimen. Malawi has been meeting these indicators throughout the years and sustained its Polio surveillance robustly. The Ministry has in place Independent National Polio Expert Committees (National Expert Committee and the National Polio Certification Committee) which oversee and coordinate the polio surveillance and reporting system in the Country in line with the WHO recommendations.\n\nIn line with the WHO guidance and the International Health Regulations (IHR), the country is immediately putting in place additional activities in order to contain the situation in the Country. The first step is declaring this as a Public Health Emergency, the President on 17th February 2022, through the minister of Health declared a Public Health Emergency following confirmation of an imported case of polio in one of the districts There will be Emergence Operations Committee (EOC) meetings and a risk assessment of the situation will be done with support from our partners such as the WHO. We will also work very closely with our neighboring Countries and diseases know no borders.\n\nAs stated earlier, the laboratory results show that this is an imported virus as there is no evidence of community circulation of the virus. The Ministry of health has assured the nation that the situation is under control and would like to encourage the general public to continue observing good personal hygiene practice since the virus is spread through ingestion of contaminated food or water. The public has therefore been informed that the polio outbreak has been declared a Public Health Emergency by the Malawi Government.\n\n2. Updates as of 21st February 2022\n\nâ€¢\tMoH has established an EOC at CHSU, TB Conference hall where different MoH departments and partners are meeting on a daily basis. MRCS is attending EOC meetings.\nâ€¢\tThere is a global technical expert that has arrived in the country led by the Polio Technical International Committee to support Malawi in conducting surveillance and other interventions.\nâ€¢\tThe EOC is conducting a Risk Assessment and a report is expected by Monday 21 Feb 2022\nâ€¢\tThere is also a Social Working (RCCE) Group within the EoC that has been established to work on Social Mobilization activities among others social mapping/assessment and community engagement.

The overall objective of the appeal is to ensure that immediate and recovery needs of the affected people are met in a dignified manner. The operation is being implemented using the â€œbuilding back better â€œapproach. The appeal targets a total of 161,000 people representing 32, 200 households with average of 5 people per household. The appeal has to date attracted a total budget of CHF 2,940,008 (IFRC: CHF 2,081,087, Danish RC: 507,974. CERF/IOM CHF 350,947 against the appeal budget valued at CHF4,500,000 and CHF 6,500,000 Federation Wide Budget for estimated period of 18 months. This means that the national society in collaboration with the in-country partners and other well-wishers are still mobilizing resources to effectively support the affected populations. Efforts are demonstrated through disseminating the impacts of the cyclones to the affected communities and regular profiling of the current operation.",

The alert indicated that the Southern and Central Regions of the country will be affected beginning early November 2021. Following the alerts a number of districts including Lilongwe, Mulanje, Mangochi, Chikwawa, Ntcheu, Machinga, Balaka, Zomba, Chiradzulu, Phalombe, Salima and Blantyre have already been greatly affected.  \n\nSo far, a total of 7,979 households have been affected. The Department of Disaster Management Affairs has registered 13 deaths (seven due to lightning strikes and six because of collapsed walls due to strong winds and stormy rains) and 51 injuries for the period July 2021 to November 19, 2021. Some of the affected households are being hosted by the families and neighbours within the communities. \n\nFurthermore, on 21st November 2021, the Department of Climate Change and Meteorological Services (DCCMS) released a new warning, which cautioned Malawians to brace for heavy rains coupled with thunderstorms associated with destructive gusty strong winds, which will hit the South and gradually move to central and northern region parts of the country November 24 to Sunday, November 28, 2021.\n\nWeather Alert!!!\n\nWay forward\nBased on the weather alerts, MRCS will continue to monitor the situation but also undertake the following anticipatory actions/ Early actions. The actions will seek to protect people before a disaster strike based on early warning or forecasts. In addition, MRCS will ensure that there is meaningful involvement and engagement of the communities at-risk. \n\n\n\nMRCS has been working with the Department of Disaster Management Affair and 4,180 households have been supported with Relief items, anticipatory messages, and activation of volunteers who have supported with capacity building in assessments, dissemination of alerts and support identification of evacuation centres as well as provision of early warning messages.\nThe glowing numbers of households being affected, the limited number partners supporting the response and the diminishing MRCS stocks compounded with the recent alert by DCCMS has resulted in MRCS being in high need of external support to address the current and future needs. \n\nIt is against this background that MRCS intends to apply for DREF to strengthen its response capacity. \n",
