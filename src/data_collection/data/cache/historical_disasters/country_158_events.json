Consequently, KwaZulu Natal, North West, Free State, Eastern Cape are likely to experience the return of thunderstorms, along with the risk of localised flooding and/or occurrences of hail and strong, damaging winds. This is adding great strain to existing flood impact which the province has been experiencing since it was hit hardest by worst floods midnight of the 11th of April 2022.\n\nThe joint rapid assessments conducted by government and stakeholders including South African Red Cross Society (SARCS within the province in 10 affected districts in the 10 affected districts are ongoing. Search and rescue teams are still active in the field and death toll has risen to 395 https://www.enca.com/news/kzn-floods-death-toll-increases-395 . So far, the adverse impacts of recent floods in KwaZulu Natal (KZN) has resulted in estimated 40 723 people affected and more 11 976 households destroyed and 264 schools destroyed. The floods impacts in KZN has resulted in displaced people to be clustered in 24 evacuation centres which were identified by the government. https://www.citizen.co.za/news/south-africa/3077609/kzn-floods-over-40k-people-affected-as-fatalities-rise/ This also make the affected people to be more vulnerable limited limited food, electricity and water supply, waterborne diseases, mental health due to stress of losing their belongings and loved ones. Other areas of KZN have been characterised by protests as some of the affected communities show their frustrations especially of clean water supply and electricity which is not available in most of the seriously affected districts",

More noteworthy, is that a few stations even reported 300 mm or more! A selection of the highest overnight rainfall measured in KwaZulu-Natal includes King Shaka International Airport (225 mm), Margate (311 mm), Mount Edgecombe (307 mm), Port Edward (188 mm) as well as Virginia airport (Durban \nnorth) with 304 mm. Such rainfall is of the order of values normally associated with tropical cyclones; however, SAWS strongly emphasised that this system is not tropical in nature, nor is it a tropical cyclone.\n\nThe above resulted in 10 districts of KwaZulu Natal namely uMkhanyakude, uthukela, uMzinyathi, uMgungundlovu, Zululand, Ethekwini, iLembe, Harry Gwala, King Cetswayo, Ugu and Amajuba being negatively affected by the impact of floods resulting in more than 6 705 people being affected and more  1341 households being totally destroyed, 2030 people displaced and 253 fatalities recorded so far. This has resulted in displaced people to be clustered in evacuation centres with some being seperated from their loved ones and 3 reported missing. This also make the affected people to be more vulnerable to waterborne diseases, mental health due to stress of loosing their belongings and loved ones. Most of the areas are not yet accessible so numbers are expected to rise.",

The civil unrest began in the province of KwaZulu-Natal on 9 July, and spread to the province of Gauteng on 11 July 2021. As of 16 July, 212 people had died in the unrest and 2,554 had been arrested. The riots and looting resulted in food shortages, fuel shortages and medical supply shortages. Kwa Zulu Natal and Gauteng account for more than half of South Africa's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and during the riots on the 12 July, the Rand, local currency, weakened by about 2% affecting the economy. More than 200 shopping centres in South Africa have been looted and property destruction costs are reported to be above 1 billion USD according to a RepublicWorld.Com, a local online news outlet.</p>\r\n<p>Other services affected are the medical and pharmaceutical retailers, while hospital services were also disrupted.

Possible impacts as a result of all this rain include widespread flooding, damage to roads and bridges as well as possible displacement of affected communities. This system is likely to result in Gauteng and North West provinces also receiving some rainfall on Monday and Tuesday, however at this stage such rainfall is not expected to be of an extreme or damaging nature or result in the impacts mentioned above.\nSAWS has highlighted that, it is important to note that the accurate prediction of the track (or path) of tropical weather disturbances is very challenging indeed. Tropical weather systems are notorious for their often erratic and unpredictable movement. SAWS will therefore continue to closely monitor this system and will keep the public advised via regular updates across a variety of media platforms.",

            "description": "In South Africa, untamed fires are on the rise in informal settlements and in low-income neighborhoods, in and around the country’s cities. Recently, on the 24 of August 2020, Kwa Zulu Natal province has experiencing shack fires in the informal settlements. The affected municipalities are uMngeni Local Municipality and eThekwini Metro Municipality. The incident in Umngeni Local Municipality (Howick) resulted from the paraffin stove that was left on whilst the shack owner was asleep. The incident in Durban was caused by the candle that was left on by the household owner in one of the shacks. Shacks in the informal settlements are closer to one another and this makes it difficult to extinguish fires during the fire break out incident as there is not much space for movement. The above tragic was experienced in Howick and Durban, leaving the community members severely affected by the fire incident.",
