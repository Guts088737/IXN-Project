            "description": "<p>In September 2023, El Niño was officially declared in FSM, raising concerns for the upcoming months. The drying trend, intensifying from October to November, typically peaks in January after an El Niño event. FSM depends on underground, surface water, and rainwater for freshwater supply. Particularly vulnerable are small, low-lying islands reliant solely on rainwater and shallow wells. Historical records reveal that previous El Niño years resulted in drought conditions during winter and spring. The impact of lack of rain is causing rain catchment and rivers systems across the nation to run dry.</p>\r\n<p>On 11 March, the President of FSM declared a State of Emergency in response to severe drought conditions across the country. The most affected states are Yap, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Chuuk. It is estimated that more than 6,000 people have been affected. On 11 March, the President of FSM declared a State of Emergency in response to severe drought conditions across the country. The most affected states are Yap, Kosrae, Pohnpei and Chuuk. The establishment of the National Emergency Task Force aims to streamline the coordination of relief supplies. As per the emergency declaration, an allocation of US$1,288,824 is designated for the Disaster Relief Fund. Furthermore, any goods procured for foreign aid projects related to the emergency will be exempt from import tax. Additionally, state authorities and agencies are encouraged to waive port charges, including wharfage, freight, and other associated fees, for the transportation of emergency-related relief equipment, supplies, and materials.</p>\r\n<p>The absence of rainfall is leading to the depletion of rain catchment and river systems throughout the country. This particularly affects residents in the Outer Islands who rely on these systems, posing a significant threat to sanitation and public health. The projected decrease in rainfall levels across FSM indicates a worrisome trend.</p>\r\n<p>According to UNICEF, an estimated 16,000 individuals, with children comprising 40 percent of this population, are facing severe food insecurity. Numerous families are grappling with the challenge of ensuring sufficient nutrition for their children due to the impact of the drought on agriculture. Reports indicate substantial damage to taro patches, exacerbating the situation further.</p>\r\n<p>As per updates from the Weather Forecast Office in Guam, the drought situation in Micronesia is intensifying. Multiple authoritative sources, including the U.S. Drought Monitor, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, forecast prolonged dry conditions. Water catchment levels across the islands are notably low, exacerbated by crop damage stemming from a coastal flooding incident on January 20th.

            "description": "El Nino is an evolving situation where the ocean temperature is expected to rise. Warmer waters in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean can suppress the formation of clouds and rain. The hot weather in the North Pacific will trigger more evaporation and available water sources will deplete, while demands for water may increase. Many North Pacific Islands are dependent on the rains to meet daily water demands. The increase in heat and decrease in rainfall means the scarcity of water for inhabitants of the islands. Most of the Islands in the North Pacific countries are remote and transportation is very expensive that which may worsen the situation if early readiness actions are not taken place. \n\nRecent El Niño events occurred in 2015-16 and 2018-19. The El Nino in 2015-16 was very strong which resulted in the worst drought in the history of the North Pacific affecting Palau, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), and the Marshall Islands.  The El Nino was much weaker in 2018-2019 however most of Micronesia i.e., Yap state, Palau, and Mariana Islands experienced extensive drought in the early months of 2020. In the past El Niño years, FSM suffered from drought conditions during the winter and spring months. Because they are further west, Yap and western Chuuk tend to be affected earlier and more harshly. In an El Niño year, the winds are weaker than normal (or absent). Warm ocean water from Micronesia surges into the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. This leads to a falling sea level and a greater chance of drought in Micronesia.",

This has placed North Pacific on El Niño alert triggering our need for early actions and preparedness for drought. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), a transition from ENSO-neutral to El Niño has taken place during May-July 2023. According to the International Research Institute (IRI) of Columbia Climate School, as of mid-Aug 2023, the previously moderate El Niño conditions in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific have strengthened further. Key oceanic and atmospheric variables are consistent with the El Niño, though the atmosphere is not yet fully coupled to the warm sea surface temperature anomalies in the central-eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. A CPC El Niño advisory remains in place for August 2023. Almost all of the models in the IRI ENSO prediction plume forecast an El Niño event during boreal autumn continuing into winter and early spring of 2024, while weakening during the end of the forecast and ENSO-neutral become the most likely category (Apr-Jun 2024 with 59% chance)</span></p>\r\n<p>El Nino is an evolving situation where the ocean temperature is expected to rise. Warmer waters in the Equatorial Pacific Ocean can suppress the formation of clouds and rain. The hot weather in the North Pacific will trigger more evaporation and available water sources will deplete, while demands for water may increase. Many North Pacific Islands are dependent on the rains to meet daily water demands. The increase in heat and decrease in rainfall means the scarcity of water for inhabitants of the islands. Most of the Islands in the North Pacific countries are remote and transportation is very expensive that which may worsen the situation if early readiness actions are not taken place. Recent El Niño events occurred in 2015-16 and 2018-19. The El Nino in 2015-16 was very strong which resulted in the worst drought in the history of the North Pacific affecting Palau, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), and the Marshall Islands. The El Nino was much weaker in 2018-2019 however most of Micronesia i.e., Yap state, Palau, and Mariana Islands experienced extensive drought in the early months of 2020. In the past El Niño years, FSM suffered from drought conditions during the winter and spring months. Because they are further west, Yap and western Chuuk tend to be affected earlier and more harshly. In an El Niño year, the winds are weaker than normal (or absent). Warm ocean water from Micronesia surges into the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. This leads to a falling sea level and a greater chance of drought in Micronesia.</p>",
