            "description": "Number of people from Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan crossing the Polish – Belarusian border started rapidly increasing at the end of May this year. The Polish Border Guard (PBG) officially reported the first incidents of detaining groups of people who illegally had crossed the PL-BY border at the end of May. At this time the total number of people illegally crossing the PL-BY border detained by PBG was 78 since the beginning of 2021. From May this number started rapidly growing and was: - 112 on 7th June - 337 on 21st July - reaching 349 of people detained in only 3 days from 6th to 8th August giving 871 total number YTD By the end of August PBG reported 3500 attempts of illegal crossing the PL-BY border, from which 2500 were prevented and 1000 people were detained and placed in secured refugee detention centres. It almost utilized all the current capacity of these centres at that time. In October PBG reports 500-700 of illegal attempts to cross the PL-BY border per day. On September 2nd Poland declared a state of emergency on the 400 km long PL-BY border and territory c/a 2km wide into Poland. Media started reporting that PBG is returning the migrants back to the BY border. But after that people are blocked by BY guards and forced to get back to PL territory. According to media, push-backs happen often towards the same group of people. They cannot get back to BY and have no entry to Poland. On September 30th the state of emergency was extended for the next 60 days and will last by the end of November. Among other restrictions - all media and NGOs are banned from entering the state of emergency zone from the very first day. There’s no reliable information what exactly happens with people within the zone but there are reports from people who live there that: - people are hiding in the woods because they don’t want to be detained by PBG. - people are not prepared to stay outside in Polish autumn conditions: o they are not dressed properly and struggle from chill and wet weather and suffer from hypothermia o because they are staying even 20-30 days in the woods – they’re running out of food supplies - there are women, pregnant women and children of every age who are very vulnerable in that situation and have special needs (clothes, food, medical assistance) which are not covered - there’s number of minor and major injuries and health issues that are not healed - they are running of medicaments they should take regularly if prescribed by the doctor Risks given above cause that number of c/a 10-20 people a day on average decide to call for help or are found by the local community somewhere outside the emergency zone. 7 dead people were found until October 7th and it is expected this number will increase due to more and more cold weather conditions (in winter in this side of Poland temperatures -10C is nothing unusual and can fall down even below -20C). PRC send official letters to the Minister of Interior requesting an access to the state of emergency zone 4 times. Once it was also sent to the President of Poland, Prime Minister and Parliament. Several phone call talks with the Vice-Minister of Interior were also held. All these resulted in negative answers explained by the risk for the humanitarian actors safety in the zone and readiness of PBG to provide humanitarian assistance to migrants.",

            "description": "We take the situation with migrants extremely seriously. We are in constant contact with representatives of state authorities, public organizations, and international partners. We have only one task - to help those who need it. We are grateful for the support of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, International Organization for Migration (IOM), UNHCR, the Afghan community in the Republic of Belarus, as well as food and light industry enterprises of Grodno region for their help. The Belarus Red Cross works closely with government agencies and international organizations to coordinate efforts and further operational assistance. On 9-10 November the staff of the Grodno regional branch of the Belarus Red Cross distributed humanitarian aid to migrants on the part of Belarus-Poland border. With support of the representatives of the Council of the Republic our staff brought to migrants food kits, which included bread and sausage products, stew, water, sweets and fruit, hygiene kits, warm clothes and socks, and blankets. Please see the Information from our official website.",

        "summary": "In May 2021, migrants arriving in Belarus started crossing the border into Lithuania. By August, more than 4,000 people had crossed and were placed first in temporary camps and later in a few facilities, pending processing of asylum applications. As Lithuania reinforced its border and introduced a state of emergency for the border zone, the routes of the migrants largely shifted towards the Polish border, with an unknown number crossing, being apprehended by the border guards and placed in centres on the border and elsewhere. Poland also reinforced its border, mobilized soldiers to assist the border guards and, in early September, declared a state of emergency. <br /><br />Despite reinforcements on the border, attempts by people to irregularly cross into the European Union have continued in the past couple of months, with the authorities in Lithuania and Poland reporting hundreds of attempts every day. Many people spend days and weeks in the terrain by the border. To date, ten people are reported to have died, exhausted and exposed to low temperatures. <br /><br />In early November, the situation escalated when a several thousand migrants approached the borders with Poland, but also Lithuania, from the Belarusian side. This led to a tense stand-off and some clashes between border guards and migrants. Most people who were at the border have now been moved to a nearby hall. <br /><br />The majority of people affected in the context are from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Syria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Yemen, Sudan and other Middle East, African and Asian countries. Tens of nationalities were reported among those crossing into Lithuania in July and August. Across the context there are significant numbers of women and children – around 40% of those entering Lithuanian, for example – as well as unaccompanied minors and persons with disabilities. <br /><br />The three National Red Cross Societies of Lithuania, Poland and Belarus have played a critical role as local actors in responding to humanitarian needs throughout this context. Belarus Red Cross is the only organization with continuous access to the border zone in Belarus and has been distributing relief goods there since the stand-off started. Both Lithuanian Red Cross and Polish Red Cross have made assistance available for people in border areas they cannot access directly. The Polish Red Cross recently agreed with the authorities on restricted yet regular access to some centres in the border zone and both National Societies continue to advocate for full and regular access to all migrants, wherever they may be. Both the Lithuanian and the Polish Red Cross are also supporting people in centres outside of the closed border zones as well as people on the move. Given the unique role of these National Societies, it is vital to ensure operational resources, but also to continue to build their capacity and strengthened readiness to act in disaster and crises situations.<br /><br />This Emergency Appeal will prioritize support to the three National Red Cross Societies who are currently operational in the context. The Emergency Appeal may however also extend to other countries that could be impacted by the situation. The funding requirement is based on ongoing activities and also includes contingency to allow for a quick scale-up and targeting in any of the countries, should the situation so require. The Emergency Appeal also aims to significantly improve on the National Societies’ capacities to respond in rapidly developing context, including future disasters and crises situations.",
