            "description": "Since mid July 2021 Albania territory is affected by heat wave with temperature which reached up to 43 degrees in Kucove. Because of this high temperature and some man made behaviors ( shapers burning grass, people thouing flaming cigarettes while passing near forests, burning straw etc.) while fires spread in different areas of Albania country. \nFor several days now, Albania has been engulfed by fires, almost throughout its territory. According to official data from the Civil Emergency Agency, the fires have spread from north to south, including forests, pastures and private property in 13 districts: Shkodra, Lezha, Puka, Elbasan, Fier, Skrapar, Durres, Tirana, Vlora, Gjirokastra, Përmet and Saranda where 9 fires are active. \nHundreds of hectares of forests, pastures and thousands of olive roots have been destroyed in Vlora and Fier. Residents of 3 villages in the Drino River valley in Gjirokastra have been evacuated by Police and Army forces. \nThere are 521 military forces at the scene, dozens from the local government as fire and civil emergency forces, 50 vehicles. Work is underway to extinguish the flames from the air with FA helicopters and contracted. Meanwhile Albanian Government has required help from EU Civil Protection Mechanism.\nAlbanian Red Cross is following very closely the current situation mostly through RC branches in affected areas. Also we are raising awareness through social media (FB, Instagram, Website etc)  for preventing dangerous behaviors (mentioned above) and also avoiding going out during the high temperatures. \n\nFor several days, the operational forces, effectives of the Army, firefighters, civil emergency troups and local services are working to extinguish fires in various areas of the country. Despite uninterrupted work, some fires are still active and problematic.\n\nThe fire continues to be active in the village of Dukat i Ri, on the Karaburun peninsula, which increased the risk for spreading towards the Llogara National Park. From the first hours of the morning, the operation for extinguishing the fire from the air has resumed.\n\nThe other critical zones is the one at the top of Runa, above the Kalimash tunnel, where work has continued to keep it under control so that the flames do not pose a danger to houses.\nIn the village of Thirrë in Fan of Mirdita, the fire does not pose a danger to homes, while work is underway to extinguish it.\nThe fire in the village of Munella-Domgjon has been isolated on one side, but work is continuing on the other side, where there are still flames.\nSince yesterday, work is being done to extinguish the flames in the pine forest in the village of Krushovo, in the administrative unit of Voskopoja. From the first hours, the intervention forces of Army, firefighters and other structures of the municipality of Korça and neighboring municipalities have been increased.\n\nThe difficult fire situation was yesterday, in the village of Patalej, Kolsh administrative unit, Mirditë municipality. Today the fire in the bushes continues, while the operational forces have been increased.\n\nIn the village of Corrush in Mallakastër, two hearths have been isolated, but work continues to isolate the flames in three other active hearths, which are in difficult terrain.\nIn the village of Bogë, the administrative unit Shkrel, a fire was activated last night. It does not pose a risk to houses\nA fire has been reported in Tomorri Park at an altitude of over 1500 m, but the situation is being followed by local forces.",
