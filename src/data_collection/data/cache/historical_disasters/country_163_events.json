Consequences of severe, recent droughts for the country have resulted in 25% of the population is vulnerable and acknowledged as food and water insecure, with many households still reliant on welfare and social safety nets.

From October 2023 to March 2024, it is projected that approximately 268,000 people will be classified in IPC Phase 3 (Crisis), and nearly 15,000 will be in IPC Phase 4 (Emergency). The IPC report further indicates that Dry Middleveld (DMV) and the Lowveld Cattle and Maize (LCM) have the highest proportion of the population (30%) classified in IPC Phase 3 indicative of high food insecurity levels in the zones for the current period (Oct 2023-March 2024). During the projected period, these zones will see an increase of 5% of their population in IPC Phase 3 or above and have the highest number of people in IPC Phase 3 or above for both periods of the analysis. Additionally, the Lubombo Plateau will also see 10% of its population falling to worse phases increasing the population in IPC Phase 3 or above to 35% (16,000 from 11,000). </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Titillium Web'; color: #333333;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"font-size: 10.5pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Titillium Web'; color: #333333; background: white;\">The main reasons for the rise in food insecurity are the prolonged impact of COVID-19, which is a key driver of food insecurity, and the increasing level of unemployment which has fluctuated from 23.5% in 2020 to 33.5% in November 2021. Social unrest has led to the destruction of businesses in urban and peri-urban areas which used to supply foodstuffs from the urban areas to the rural areas. This was worsened by dry spells in November and December 2020 which negatively affected the start of the farming season, crop production, and prolonged rains in February due to Cyclone Eloise, which resulted in flooding in most areas, causing crop damage and poor yields. The impacts of COVID-19 have continued to be a driver of food insecurity and are expected to worsen in peri-urban and urban populations due to the increase in unemployment. The predicted fourth wave of COVID-19 is expected to escalate the strain on fiscal prudence since the Government will be expected to increase support for the health sector and food security sectors. It is important to address this issue. </span><span lang=\"EN-GB\" style=\"mso-bidi-font-family: Calibri; mso-bidi-theme-font: minor-latin;\">One of the effects of food insecurity is increased malnutrition at the household level.
