It is forecasted that more regions in the northern part will experience flooding as a result of above normal rainfall. The historical impact analysis has shown that, over the past years, the floods impacted around 70,000 people (source: CIMA, UNIDSR, 2018, Ghana Disaster Risk Profile)</p>\r\n<p>Ghana is affected by:<br />- Flash floods worst in urban areas due to urbanization challenges <br />- Revering flooding mainly linked to the important river systems length crossing from Others countries, especially Burkina Faso and going through all the North regions up to the South of Ghana. The most overflowing rivers are the White and black Volta and its tributaries like Oti River, which flows into Lake Volta from the northeast.</p>\r\n<p>The connection of this river system with Burkina Faso is worsening the overall flooding situation in Ghana since the annual spilling of water from Bagre Dam in Burkina Faso make an overflowing of all the river system in Ghana, impacting first the Northern regions and areas around the rivers, beaches and dams in Northern region, Upper East, Savannah, Northeast, and Upper West. Bagre Dam is open annually when it reach 255 M which is the maximum level.</p>\r\n<p>GRCS historical data analysis shows that authorities usually alert the NADMO (National Disaster Management Organization) in Ghana in charge of disseminating the information. In the past, Hydroelectric Production Department of SONABEL of Burkina Faso, open the Bagre Dam on 1st September 2022 when it reach 235M. In 2018 it was in 31 August. In general, over the years, the opening of Dam happen from 30 August to 3rd September. Others dam spilling can also be recorded but Bagre is the recurrent one.</p>",

After assessment, it was declared emergency by the Government on 13th August 2021. The joint rapid assessment by National Disaster Management Organization (NADMO) and Ghana Red Cross Society reported that a total of 2350 people were affected one way or the other in the Region, out of which 345 are children, 2 persons were reported dead across the region. Out of 1859 displaced people from their homes and 357 took shelter in Chiripon Basic School. A total of 85 communities from 6 districts were negatively affected by the floods. Over 335 houses were total destroyed with 256 others partially destroyed with occupants displaced and sheltered in nearby schools, and with relatives. The flood washed off major road roads in the area, farmlands, with many commuters getting stranded due to the situation.
