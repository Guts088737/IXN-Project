Rainfall peaked at 235mm in Kokotsha (Kgalagadi) and 160mm in Mogoditshane, with over 50mm<br>recorded for more than 24 hours in several districts. This caused flooded homes, submerged roads, and disrupted transport networks,<br>contaminated water and sanitation.<br>Based on Assessment conducted from 21-24 by the NS as of February 21, 2025, many people were affected, including children, pregnant<br>women, the elderly, and migrants, especially the ones leaving in low lying areas across 14 districts. The floods conducted to the<br>temporarily closure of schools from February 20 to 24 February due to transport disruptions. However, Kgatleng District schools only<br>opened on 4th March 2025 as the situation was worse, with the exception of Linchwe II Junior Secondary School only opens on 17th<br>February 2025 as it was severely affected by the flooding. The floods damaged homes, household items, and food supplies, forcing some<br>residents into evacuation centers. 2,318 people were evacuated and other thousands displaced as at 26 February 2025.<br>As at 02.03. 2025, 402 persons are still in evacuation centre and the rest released to return home. Several major roads were closed,<br>further restricting access.<br>The above events followed the Botswana Government warning issued on of 19, February 2025 projecting a continued rainfall that will be<br>above average. The Botswana Government warning indicated that persistent downpours were expected to continue, potentially<br>worsening the situation in already affected areas. From climate projections, the flooding are worsened by La Niña conditions and broader<br>regional weather patterns.<br>The Government of Botswana, through the various affected districts has been requesting Botswana Red Cross Society to complement Government efforts in supporting affected communities. The severe effects of the storms and floods in the country from late 2024 have<br>been weakening the response capacity in country, urging for additional resources to cover for this new events. A national disaster<br>taskforce has been formed where The Botswana Red Cross Society (BRCS) has a role to plan. Through this DREF allocation, NS is targeting<br>9,000 individuals (3,167 households) in Ghanzi, Kgatleng, Tlokweng, and Gaborone. the",

This marks the third consecutive year of severe drought, affecting arable agricultural land in a context where 70% of the rural population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods, primarily through rain-fed farming. Since then, 163,000 people are affected by drought. The SADC Synthesis Report on The State of Food and Nutrition Security and Vulnerability in Southern Africa indicated that <strong>37,000 individuals in Botswana are experiencing food insecurity</strong> in 2024.<br>The <strong>El Niño</strong> conditions in Southern Africa have further exacerbated the already critical drought situation. According to the Southern Africa Seasonal Monitor report, Botswana is currently experiencing El Niño conditions, leading to severe rain deficits and challenging harvest conditions across most of the region, with dry spells expected to persist. The government of Botswana expressed concerns about imminent food and livestock feed shortages due to unfavorable weather conditions impacting crop production.</p>\r\n<p>On May 24, 2024, the Rural Development Secretariat under the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development issued a report urging support due to the devastating impact of drought on food security, nutrition, water and food production. The report highlighted a significant decline in crop yields, with a <strong>drop from 206,572 tons harvested in 2021/22 to 125,184 tons in 2022/23.</strong> <strong>Cereal production in 2022/23 reached only 67,530 tons, which is equivalent to just 23% of the national requirement</strong>.
