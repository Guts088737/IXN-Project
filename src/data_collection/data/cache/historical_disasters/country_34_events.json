Rainfall peaked at 235mm in Kokotsha (Kgalagadi) and 160mm in Mogoditshane, with over 50mm<br>recorded for more than 24 hours in several districts. This caused flooded homes, submerged roads, and disrupted transport networks,<br>contaminated water and sanitation.<br>Based on Assessment conducted from 21-24 by the NS as of February 21, 2025, many people were affected, including children, pregnant<br>women, the elderly, and migrants, especially the ones leaving in low lying areas across 14 districts. The floods conducted to the<br>temporarily closure of schools from February 20 to 24 February due to transport disruptions. However, Kgatleng District schools only<br>opened on 4th March 2025 as the situation was worse, with the exception of Linchwe II Junior Secondary School only opens on 17th<br>February 2025 as it was severely affected by the flooding. The floods damaged homes, household items, and food supplies, forcing some<br>residents into evacuation centers. 2,318 people were evacuated and other thousands displaced as at 26 February 2025.<br>As at 02.03. 2025, 402 persons are still in evacuation centre and the rest released to return home. Several major roads were closed,<br>further restricting access.<br>The above events followed the Botswana Government warning issued on of 19, February 2025 projecting a continued rainfall that will be<br>above average. The Botswana Government warning indicated that persistent downpours were expected to continue, potentially<br>worsening the situation in already affected areas. From climate projections, the flooding are worsened by La Ni√±a conditions and broader<br>regional weather patterns.<br>The Government of Botswana, through the various affected districts has been requesting Botswana Red Cross Society to complement Government efforts in supporting affected communities. The severe effects of the storms and floods in the country from late 2024 have<br>been weakening the response capacity in country, urging for additional resources to cover for this new events. A national disaster<br>taskforce has been formed where The Botswana Red Cross Society (BRCS) has a role to plan. Through this DREF allocation, NS is targeting<br>9,000 individuals (3,167 households) in Ghanzi, Kgatleng, Tlokweng, and Gaborone. the",
