According to the United Nations, Over 1 million people have been displaced from their homes in the Gaza Strip, and thousands of homes and businesses have been destroyed. The conflict has also caused widespread damage to infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and water and electricity systems.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"Boldintrotext\"><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">In addition to the destruction of property, the conflict has also had a devastating impact on people's lives. The total statistics according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health show that Gaza reported cases since the beginning of the events 4,137 deaths, in addition to more than 13,162 injuries. Most of the injuries are caused by shrapnel and gunshot wounds. The conflict has also caused widespread trauma and psychological distress.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">The total cases dealt with by PRCS ambulance teams since the beginning of the events are (6007) cases, including 1464 fatalities and 4543 injuries.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">The health system in the Gaza Strip is struggling to cope with the influx of casualties. Hospitals are overcrowded, and medical supplies are running low. The power grid is also damaged, making it difficult to operate hospitals and other essential services. Since the start of the escalation of hostilities, four schools and eight healthcare facilities in Gaza have sustained damage.</span><br><br><strong><a name=\"_Hlk148628161\"></a><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; color: #212121;\">Since the closure of the border, 105 Palestinians have been stuck on the Egyptian side of the border.

The Egyptian Red Crescent is the only organization with access to North Sinai and already holds operations and projects in the area.</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"Boldintrotext\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk148628011;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">Today on the 21st of October 2023, a total of 20 ERCS trucks crossed the Rafah borders carrying aid that is based on the coordinated needs of PRCS, which included </span></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"Boldintrotext\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk148628011;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">Six trucks carrying: Medicine</span></span></li>\n<li class=\"Boldintrotext\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk148628011;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">Seven trucks: Medical Consumbles</span></span></li>\n<li class=\"Boldintrotext\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk148628011;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">Five trucks: Food Items.</span></span></li>\n<li class=\"Boldintrotext\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk148628011;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">Two trucks: Water</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"Boldintrotext\"><span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk148628011;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: 'Open Sans'; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Open Sans'; color: #212121; mso-fareast-language: EN-GB; font-weight: normal;\">The trucks make their way into Gaza through the PRCS, in coordination with authorities on both sides to ensure the safe delivery of items.&nbsp;</span></span></p>",

According to the United Nations Over 187,518 people have been displaced from their homes in the Gaza Strip, and thousands of homes and businesses have been destroyed. The conflict has also caused widespread damage to infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and water and electricity systems. About 3,000 Palestinians in Gaza are still displaced following previous escalations.(1)<br><br>In addition to the destruction of property, the conflict has also had a devastating impact on people's lives. The total statistics according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health that Gaza reported cases since the beginning of the events (1100) Deaths, including (270) children and (240) women, in addition to more than (5339) injuries. The majority of the injuries are caused by shrapnel and gunshot wounds. The conflict has also caused widespread trauma and psychological distress.

Hospitals are overcrowded and medical supplies are running low. The power grid is also damaged, making it difficult to operate hospitals and other essential services. Since the start of the escalation of hostilities, four schools and eight healthcare facilities in Gaza have sustained damage.<br><br>Since the closure of the border, 37 Palestinians have been stuck on the Egyptian side of the border. They are suffering from a lack of food, medication, and shelter.<br><!-- [if !supportLineBreakNewLine]--><span style=\"font-size: 10pt; line-height: 104%;\">The already dire humanitarian context inside Gaza is deteriorating further resulting in large-scale displacement inside Gaza and potentially across the Rafah border into Egypt. <br><br>It is Israel will keep all entry and exit points to Gaza, closed for the coming months and as will not allow the opening of a humanitarian corridor for emergency goods and into Gaza.&nbsp; <br><br>Drawing from past escalation events and historical context, Egypt has played a crucial role in facilitating medical treatment for critically injured individuals evacuated to its hospitals, hosting displaced populations, and acting as a channel for humanitarian aid destined for the Gaza Strip, either originating from Egypt or dispatched internationally through it.

Over 1.9 million people in Gaza are estimated to be internally displaced [OCHA]. The Gaza Strip has been under an electricity blackout since 11 October 2023, and a severe fuel shortage has led to the closure of most hospitals, particularly in the north.

        "summary": "<p>Twelve days of hostilities have resulted in a dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, putting the lives and livelihoods of some 1.7 million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip at risk. According to the United Nations, 242 Palestinians were killed in Gaza between 10 May and the start of the ceasefire on 21 May, including 66 children and 38 women. In addition, the number of internally displaced people has increased to 91,000. There are still roughly 1,000 people whose homes have been demolished or severely damaged. Concerns have been raised about the spread of COVID-19 among vulnerable persons huddled in overcrowded shelters and the healthcare system’s inability to cope.</p>\r\n<p>The hostilities have also wreaked havoc on Gaza’s vital infrastructure disrupting hundreds of thousands of people’s access to electricity, fuel, water, sanitation, and hygiene services.</p>\r\n<p>Electrical power outages and the damage to the Gaza Ministry of Health Central Laboratory, which performs COVID-19 testing, have hampered health services in dozens of Gaza medical centres. Hundreds of structures and residences have been destroyed, damaged, or rendered uninhabitable.</p>\r\n<p>The land port of Rafah is the only gate at the Egyptian-Palestinian border crossing. It opened a day earlier than intended to allow students, passengers, and injured individuals and their families to pass through. On a daily basis, roughly 200 passengers travel by, except for Friday and Saturday.</p>\r\n<p>The Egyptian Ministry of Health (MoH) has dispatched roughly 160 ambulances to the border in preparation for the arrival of casualties. A medical committee from MoH was present at the border crossing to evaluate the casualties as they arrived and distribute them among three designated hospitals in North Sinai with cases being sent to Cairo if more medical assistance is required. The Egyptian Ministry of Health and the Palestinian Ministry of Health work closely together to transfer cases that require advanced or additional medical attention.</p>\r\n<p>The Rafah Gate has remained open for humanitarian aid and civilians crossing to Gaza till now. Although the number of people entering has lessened since the ceasefire on May 21st, ERC is still responding to the affected people who have come through from Gaza and are continuing to come, with the possibility of scaling up if the situation worsens.</p>\r\n<p>ERC, in coordination with local authorities at the border, is assisting passengers, injured people, and relatives in obtaining the necessary documents at the port, as well as providing them PFA and light meal.</p>\r\n<p>In response to the clashes in Gaza, the Egyptian Red Crescent (ERC) opened 24-hour operations centers at its headquarters, North Sinai, and Ismailia branches in July 2014 to provide humanitarian aid to Palestinians. Around 500 tons of humanitarian aid (medicines, medical supplies, relief items, and food) were supplied by ERC, as well as four ambulances and fifteen cars provided by other movement partners, international organizations, and governments. The ERC's role in coordinating relief support to Gaza in collaboration with the PRCS and the Palestinian Ministry of Health, including procurement, customs clearance at borders, and direct transfer by ERC to Palestine, remains crucial.</p>",
