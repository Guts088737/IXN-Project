The <strong>continuous crop failures</strong> over the past seasons is exacerbated. The past two quarters have seen the same crop failure leading automatically to the high food prices. There are 41% of rural families spending more than half of their income on food while most of the families leave with low income. In two consecutive agricultural seasons (2021/2022 and 2022/2023), Lesotho experienced harsh climatic induced shocks such as hailstorms, pests and heavy rainfall/waterlogging in most parts of the country. On the other hand, the heavy rainfalls in late December 2023 and early 2024 led to waterlogged fields which resulted in crop failure. The inflation resulting from this crop failures or production failures have a direct incidence to the families already struggling with low income and other factors that make them more vulnerable to food insecurity.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; animation-play-state: running; margin: 1rem 0px; line-height: 1.6; color: #4a4a4a; font-family: Roboto, helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">Approximately, <strong>325,000 individuals are experiencing the effects of the ongoing food insecurity</strong> based on IPC analysis, stemming from the enduring drought that has gripped the nation for years and increased the food insecurity situation. This figure represents approximately <strong>22% of the population</strong>. Eight districts on the ten in Lesotho are under Integrated Food Security Phase Classification 3 (IPC 3), signifying a crisis state. Berea, Maseru, Mafeteng, Mohaleâ€™s Hoek, Quthing, Thaba Tseka, and Leribe areas. In these districts, access to adequate food and nutrition is severely compromised, necessitating urgent intervention and support measures to alleviate the hardship faced by affected communities.</p>\r\n<p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; animation-play-state: running; margin: 1rem 0px; line-height: 1.6; color: #4a4a4a; font-family: Roboto, helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 18px;\">It is against this background that Lesotho Red Cross request to launch a response intervention to mitigate the drought effects witnessed for the past season with an incidence on food insecurity for around 325,000 people that will certainly not be able to cope with the inflation in an already difficult context. Since OND, Government called for actions. The announcement of the production results and price increase brought <strong>Government to renew their call for assistance</strong> during the recent emergency coordination meeting.</p>",

            "description": "Lesotho was hit by yet another wind storm waves on the 09th and 10th November 2021.The situation between 9th   and 10th November 2021 worsened. This time around wind storms hit the central and Northern part (Districts) of the country. Three districts of Berea, Maseru (central) and Quthing (North) reported cases of major destruction at the range of shelter, livelihoods and other infrastructure. The impact of the strong winds resulted in serious disruption of the national economy and the livelihoods of the Basotho people particularly in the three districts of Berea, Maseru and Quthing. Over 274 houses were affected with roofing partially and completely damaged leaving an estimation of 88 householdâ€™s people homeless. The windstorms also blew away or damaged peopleâ€™s belongings, such as blankets, clothing, kitchens set and food. Most of the families lost their field s and garden due to soil erosion caused by heavy rains run offs which destroyed terracing of the fields and gardening, hence lost green harvest especially vegetables. The field crops especially maize, sorghum and beans emergence rate were affected by erosion and seeds swept away. The destruction further affected, hospitals, schools both high and primary. one bigger hospital by name of Scott Hospital was affected and roofing blown off, however, the structure is being reinstated through insurance mechanisms.  Three schools in the Berea district (one high and two primaries) were destroyed. Cana High school five class rooms blown off, Cana Primary five class rooms also blown off while Tsekelo Primary two class rooms destroyed. Lesotho Red Cross Society (LRCS) and the Disaster Management Authority (including stakeholders from the District Disaster Management Team (DDMT) and the National Society) conducted a rapid assessment between the 10th and 14th of November 2021 and thus assessment revealed that in Berea, Maseru and Quthing a cumulatively, 274 houses (1065 People) were affected by the storm. The assessment was lengthy due to the fact that some villages were hard to reach. Out of the affected households, 88 households (359 people) were completely destroyed and families have been displaced, currently hosted by neighbours or relatives. The remaining 186 families (648 people) whose houses were damaged are using undamaged part of the houses, although they have lost their basic household items.\n In Berea at least three schools were destroyed and twelve classes rooms blown off. \n Cumulatively, the windstorms caused damage to 274 houses, (1065 people) of which 186 families (648 people) were partially destroyed and at least have alternative shelter to use, while 88 households (359 people) their shelter is completely destroyed and housed at their relatives and neighbours, domestic items completely destroyed. \nAccording to information collected by Lesotho Red Cross Society and national assessment teams, at least 274 families (10654 people) are affected to date as assessment continues. Basic needs include housing materials, food items, and household items (NFIs), such as blankets, kitchen sets and hygiene kits are needed.\n\nBased on the above, this DREF request will initially focus on supporting the urgent needs of the affected communities which include, psycho social support, food and nutrition, shelter materials and hygiene kit materials. The response will be revised within 3 to 4 weeks, to include a full operational strategy based on further assessments. The DREF operation will focus in Berea, Maseru and Quthing areas, where the impact of storms was greatest. ",
