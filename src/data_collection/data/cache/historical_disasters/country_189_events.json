While no other new regions are specifically mentioned, the overall increase in reported cases suggests a nationwide rise in transmission. The report does not specify affected population groups based on age or vulnerability, but it highlights a general increase in community-level infections, indicating that all citizens are at potential risk and should remain vigilant.\n\nFrom February to April 2025, infection rates rose significantly—from 1.4% in February (2 out of 139 tested) to 16.3% in March (31 out of 190 tested), and 16.8% in April (31 out of 185 tested). This steady increase confirms a worsening trend in the spread of the virus. In response, the Ministry of Health has intensified disease surveillance and testing efforts at health centers. Citizens are strongly advised to seek immediate medical care if they experience symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, muscle pain, or breathing difficulties.",

In Kyela District, excess runoff from the highlands overflowed into Lake Nyasa, inundating 15 villages across 5 wards. The wards most affected and currently hosting displaced populations in evacuation centers include Katumba Songwe, Mwaya, Kajunjumele, and Ipinda. A total of over 452 households (approx. 3,150 individuals) have been displaced and are currently sheltered in 4 evacuation sites, including schools and temporary shelters. No deaths have been reported in this incident, though five individuals are missing and 21 have sustained injuries.

Out of 13 regions, a Cholera outbreak was declared over in 5 regions (Mara, Kigoma, Arusha, Kilimanjaro, and Dodoma). Cases in Mwanza, Shinyanga, Simiyu and Kagera regions have continued to increase to date, making these regions the most affected at present. The trend of this disease shows that there is a risk of the disease spreading further, if necessary, measures are not put in place. With the ongoing El nino a long rains period expected to start in March through May 2024, there is a probability that these cases will rise, and more regions will be affected. </p>\r\n<p>Tanzania has never experienced an almost countrywide spread of cholera infections in the last 4 decades. At most, it has only been witnessed and quickly contained in up to two regions concurrently per year. With the present El Nino rains in all 31 administrative regions of Tanzania, the existing wastewater drainage systems have been overwhelmed and many have collapsed completely, particularly those of Mwanza, Shinyanga and Kagera. The regions also happen to be the most densely populated in the country; Mwanza has the highest number of squatter-settlements with unplanned hillside infrastructure and unplanned fish markets. Shinyanga is a mining region with widespread open defecation practices in the popular weekly community food markets. The scale of this year’s heavy rainfall, the resultant overflow of latrine facilities and poor hygiene practices in the affected communities have made this epidemic spread much faster than the country’s coping mechanism could contain it.</p>",

The Tanzania Meteorological Agency estimates that over <strong>6 million people have suffered some form of impact from the heavy rains</strong> and weather models now indicate that the there is more rain due over at least in the next five days. On 3 December alone, torrential rains caused massive landslides near <strong>Mount Hanang, Manyara region,</strong> in northern Tanzania. The floods swept away houses, roads and bridges, <strong>killing at least 68 people and injuring 116</strong>. Thousands of families have lost their homes and are sheltering in public buildings and with host families. Thus far <strong>homes belonging to at least 1,150 households (5,600 people)</strong> <strong>have been damaged</strong>, with <strong>750 acres of farmland inundated</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>The damage and loss of life are expected to increase as the true extent of the disaster is understood and as more areas are accessed by search and rescue teams. Rescue operations are underway with the help of the military as people are feared buried in thick mud, and the extent of mudslides has made retrieval of bodies and delivery of aid very challenging. <strong>Road access is limited</strong>, thus air transport is being used. <strong>Telecommunication has also been disrupted</strong>. Livelihoods have been severely affected, as most of the population depends on agriculture and livestock. This <strong>heightens the risk of increased food insecurity</strong>, in a country that has seen a spike in food insecurity and malnutrition in 2023 (over 60% increase).</p>\r\n<p><strong>Response</strong>: Tanzania Red Cross Society (TRCS) has sent disaster teams and <strong>300 volunteers from the Manyara regional branch</strong> and surrounding branches to the affected areas to aid in search and rescue and first-aid, supporting those displaced with essential household items, food, water and sanitation. However, stocks are limited and much more support is needed. The <strong>Government has requested TRCS to scale up their support</strong>, and they are closely coordinating with the Department of Disaster Management within the Office of the Prime Minister. </p>",

So far, this flood has affected the village of Kivava, especially in the suburbs of Sokoni and Kivukuni, villages of Angazo, and Kilamboma, and making 1,400 people displaced, representing 395 households affected in the suburbs of the market and the port. These 1,400 displaced people have been moved to temporary shelters in primary schools that are elevated due to their houses being surrounded by water. In addition, about 60 houses have collapsed with more than 100 toilets having collapsed and fields having been destroyed by water. The road from the village of Angazo to the village of Kilambo has been damaged, thus causing a lack of transportation and communication between those areas. Kivava village is one of the 110 villages in the district council. This village has 4 neighborhoods which are sokoni, kivukoni, dinanji, and lilumbi, the number of residents in this village is 1,976 and there are 518 households. The main economic activity in the village is agriculture and food business. The cultivated crops are rice, sorghum, cassava, cashews, coconuts, and legumes. Most of the agricultural areas were washed away by floods. TRCS branch (Mtwara Red Cross regional team) aside from local authorities visited the affected villages on 5th April and issued initial assessment data to start guiding the first emergency assistance to the affected communities Page 3 / 20 through local actions.
